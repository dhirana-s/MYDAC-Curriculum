1e7x13p,"It is not the EVs, that are lacking in the US, it's the charging which needs to be reliable.","So, I own a ICE vehicle, but often will rent EVs for road trips as road trips are just better in EVs.

Now, many people have questions about the charging and complain about the increased time on road trips with EVs.

The valid complain is the charging, I'm in my 20s and even I need to stop every 3-4 hours.

Charging reliability is where it sucks.

Recently got rented an Ioniq 6. Unable to use Tesla's supercharger network (great advantage on F150 Lightning).

Excellent car, got about 290 miles of range on highway, doing 65/70.

The problem is charging.

- An Electrify America station only had one single 350kW working out of all 4 being 350kW. Two were derated down to 70-80kW because the cables were damaged and had leaked out coolant.

- One EVGo location only had 50kW 'high speed DC fast chargers'. No, they weren't derated, that's the max speed.

- An EA station wouldn't work with the app, wouldn't work with a credit card. We tried 5 times using it, and then used the 150kW next to it. Instead of 15 mins to get to 80% on 350kW we ended up charging for 35 mins.

- Map said a Tesla Supercharger had magic docks and would work for our car. Didn't work. It was a V2 version. Doesn't work for non-Teslas.

----------------------------------------

In most of the country, there are plenty of fast charging options, except for some portions. We do need more charging locations for sure, but not that many more as people imagine.

One thing though - we don't have enough chargers for peak demands during holidays, long weekends, summer etc. More chargers at the locations might be the answer, depending on utility access.

What needs to get better is charging reliability. I have not faith in EVGo and EA to actually improve their reliability once they start the J3400 standard aka the Tesla charger system.

Even with their current chargers they are improving somewhat, but they still suck.

Ultimately, it isn't the lack of charging anymore, it's the reliability of charging that needs to improve.",373,Ok-Pea3414
