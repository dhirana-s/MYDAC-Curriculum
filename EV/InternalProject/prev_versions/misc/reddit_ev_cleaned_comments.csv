m071bsm,tech57,"Work pickup vs lifestyle pickup.

People that buy ICE pickups can buy one for work or lifestyle. Those customers don't see Ford's EV version as useful in either situation. 

People that buy Tesla's pickup buy it for lifestyle. 

Look at all the early Tesla adopters back in the day. Do people really think they bought them as a tool to commute to work? Or maybe because they were new and cool and saving the world?

So back to Ford ICE pickup buyers, the ones that roll coal and cruise mall parking lots and go grocery shopping. Buying an EV pickup from Ford would be a negative to both work and lifestyle. 

Ford's EV pickup was made so they could stay in business. Tesla's EV pickup was mostly a pet project.

The problem here is that Tesla needs to work their way down from $100k to $40k to even have a hope of fulfilling what's left of their initial reservations, and they have neither a record (nor realistically a hope) of doing that sort of thing. **The MY made it from \~$60k to \~$45k, not from \~$100k to \~40k.**

The CT which was pegged to peak at $69k (for a tri-motor, 500mi trim) when when it was first announced, doesn't even reach that price today at the the *lowest* trim level. It likely won't *ever*. All that demand has evaporated as a possibility.

You can say it's not alienation but rather an inability to meet the original quoted price, but vague mumbles of *""ahh yeah but they'll bring the price down, they always do""* are just wishcasting: They can't bring the price down that much.

m06wvaw,whimsy-penguin,"I thought about steel rims recently to make buying a winter tire set cheap.  I ended up going with Alloy for performance/efficiency reasons.  Here is a nice write up from ChatGPT:

# Steel Rims

* **Strength and Durability**: Steel rims are very strong and can handle heavy loads, which is suitable for EVs as they are typically heavier due to their battery packs.
* **Cost**: They are less expensive than alloy wheels.
* **Repairability**: Steel rims are easier to repair if bent or damaged.
* **Weight**: Steel wheels are heavier than alloy wheels, which can impact the performance and efficiency of an EV. The added weight may reduce range slightly and affect handling.

# Alloy Wheels

* **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Alloy wheels are lighter than steel rims, which improves handling, acceleration, and overall efficiency. This is particularly advantageous for EVs, as reduced weight helps maximize range.
* **Heat Dissipation**: Alloy wheels dissipate heat better, which can be beneficial for braking systems, especially in heavier EVs.
* **Appearance**: Alloys typically look more stylish and are available in various designs.
* **Cost and Durability**: Alloy wheels are more expensive than steel and are more prone to cracking under impact compared to steel rims.

# Conclusion

Steel rims can safely support the weight of an EV, but alloy wheels may provide better performance and efficiency. The choice depends on priorities:

* For cost-effectiveness and durability, **steel rims** are better.
* For performance, aesthetics, and range optimization, **alloy wheels** are the preferred option.

For EVs, manufacturers often equip them with alloy wheels due to their lighter weight and efficiency benefits.",1733229636.0,1,thought steel rim recently make buying winter tire set cheap ended going alloy performanceefficiency reason nice write chatgpt steel rim strength durability steel rim strong handle heavy load suitable ev typically heavier due battery pack cost less expensive alloy wheel repairability steel rim easier repair bent damaged weight steel wheel heavier alloy wheel impact performance efficiency ev added weight may reduce range slightly affect handling alloy wheel strengthtoweight ratio alloy wheel lighter steel rim improves handling acceleration overall efficiency particularly advantageous ev reduced weight help maximize range heat dissipation alloy wheel dissipate heat better beneficial braking system especially heavier ev appearance alloy typically look stylish available various design cost durability alloy wheel expensive steel prone cracking impact compared steel rim conclusion steel rim safely support weight ev alloy wheel may provide better performance efficiency choice depends priority costeffectiveness durability steel rim better performance aesthetic range optimization alloy wheel preferred option ev manufacturer often equip alloy wheel due lighter weight efficiency benefit

Below that your auxiliary consumption/mile rise sharply.
Above that rolling resistance rises slowly.

Auxiliary includes heating. A constant power of 3kW (up to 5kW in my EV) added to the normal ~2kW auxiliary power means the optimal speed rises. Rolling resistance rises too in winter, but on a dry road that’s not extreme.

Without entering this into Excel I’d guesstimate the optimal speed to rise to ~40-50mph using your heater in winter.

You could then reimburse them for electricity used per month just like with rent. Also L2 chargers don't usually require huge wiring upgrade and that should be enough for overnight charging. 

Another option is to talk with your employer. They might give you access to the socket while you work, maybe even treat it as a work benefit and allow it for free or some small nominal fee.

If that doesn't work look for public charging near you. Depending on how much you drive you might get away with not charging every night.

I leased the 2023 VinFast VF8 (VIN: RLLV1AFA6PH001258) on November 3, 2023, hoping to enjoy a modern, reliable electric vehicle. Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing due to multiple critical safety defects, poor customer service, and ongoing reliability issues.

**Safety Defects and Delayed Repairs**

Within just one week of taking delivery, I began encountering serious problems with the vehicle’s safety systems. I received error messages related to both the **Electronic Stability Control** and **Hydraulic Brake Assist** systems, indicating a failure in key components responsible for the vehicle’s safety. Despite reporting these issues to the service department immediately, I was told the earliest appointment for repairs would be a full month later, on **December 23rd, 2024**—a delay that I find completely unacceptable. Given the severity of these issues, the car is unsafe to drive, and the delay only amplifies my concerns about the company’s commitment to customer safety.

**New Problems Every Day**

As if the critical safety concerns weren't enough, new issues have cropped up almost daily. Recently, the **rear wiper** completely stopped working, adding another defect to an already long list of problems. It’s frustrating to purchase a brand-new vehicle only to face an ongoing stream of malfunctions, especially when the company is unable to provide timely solutions.

**Adaptive Cruise Control Failure**

Another significant issue I've encountered is with the **adaptive cruise control** system. After activating the feature, I received an error message stating “Adaptive Cruise Control Unavailable. System Fault,” rendering this feature—an important function of modern vehicles—completely useless. This only adds to the growing list of failures that have compromised the car’s usability.

**Charging Discrepancy and Misrepresentation**

One of the more frustrating issues has been with the vehicle’s range. On **November 26, 2024**, I charged the VF8 using a **ChargePoint** station, and after charging for 81.37 kWh, I was informed the car would have a range of **258 miles**. However, when I checked the vehicle’s screen, it showed a range of just **160 miles**, far below the expected performance. This discrepancy suggests that the vehicle’s charging system may not be functioning properly, further undermining my confidence in its reliability.

**Conclusion**

While I was initially excited about the VinFast VF8, my experience has been marred by poor quality control, safety concerns, and unhelpful customer service. The ongoing defects and delays have made it difficult to trust the vehicle, and I’m deeply disappointed by how the situation has been handled. I urge potential buyers to carefully consider these issues before making a purchase or lease, as my experience has proven that VinFast still has a lot of work to do when it comes to delivering a safe and reliable product.",1733204880.0,1,2023 vinfast vf8 review frustrating experience unacceptable delay safety concern leased 2023 vinfast vf8 vin rllv1afa6ph001258 november 3 2023 hoping enjoy modern reliable electric vehicle unfortunately experience nothing short disappointing due multiple critical safety defect poor customer service ongoing reliability issue safety defect delayed repair within one week taking delivery began encountering serious problem vehicle safety system received error message related electronic stability control hydraulic brake assist system indicating failure key component responsible vehicle safety despite reporting issue service department immediately told earliest appointment repair would full month later december 23rd 2024a delay find completely unacceptable given severity issue car unsafe drive delay amplifies concern company commitment customer safety new problem every day critical safety concern werent enough new issue cropped almost daily recently rear wiper completely stopped working adding another defect already long list problem frustrating purchase brandnew vehicle face ongoing stream malfunction especially company unable provide timely solution adaptive cruise control failure another significant issue ive encountered adaptive cruise control system activating feature received error message stating adaptive cruise control unavailable system fault rendering featurean important function modern vehiclescompletely useless add growing list failure compromised car usability charging discrepancy misrepresentation one frustrating issue vehicle range november 26 2024 charged vf8 using chargepoint station charging 8137 kwh informed car would range 258 mile however checked vehicle screen showed range 160 mile far expected performance discrepancy suggests vehicle charging system may functioning properly undermining confidence reliability conclusion initially excited vinfast vf8 experience marred poor quality control safety concern unhelpful customer service ongoing defect delay made difficult trust vehicle im deeply disappointed situation handled urge potential buyer carefully consider issue making purchase lease experience proven vinfast still lot work come delivering safe reliable product

I personally do think this is an EV problem because we've never had this issue before and we've lived in the same house for 20 years and had other (gas) vehicles parked outside for at least ten of them.  We think this may have happened while parked at the airport during a trip, so who knows exactly where it occurred but we thought the VW guy was crazy when he called to tell us what was wrong with the car.

m053bvb,ga2500ev,"Not the correct approach IMHO. No one chooses to leave their car away from where they live. In addition unless there is a slow charger is available for every EV, eventually someone will be left out.

I feel that EV people in general make three faulty assumptions about public charging:

1. All EV folks have ""unlimited"" time to charge.

2. That because slow charging at home is so effective that that model should be propagated into public spaces.

3. That all DCFC options are too expensive to consider both in installation and operational costs.

People don't want to sit away from home for more than an hour to charge. People don't want to have to walk to and from home to a charger. People don't want to be stuck searching for a charger they can use to charge because the ones around them are going to be used for hours to charge. And people really don't want to pay exorbitant prices for ultra high speed fast charging on a regular basis.

Also I don't get how one can presume that someone in an apartment ""doesn't use the car a lot"". What's the justification for that?

Enough of the complaints. Here's the solution:

Medium speed DC chargers in the 25-30kW speed range.

1. They are priced about 3 for 1 with commercial L2 chargers. In addition they use the same electrical infrastructure as L2 stations meaning no extra transformers need to be installed and no electrical demand charges (at least here in Georgia).

2. They charge 3-5 times faster than L2.

3. They can give a 30-50% battery charge in about an hour. With enough access, there's not going to be a need to get a full charge each and every time one uses it.

4. The dwell time matches much more in line of what people do. An hour at the grocery, or at the gym, or the coffee shop, or the library is doable. 4-8 hours is a lot tougher.

5. There no longer needs to be a 1-1 match between chargers and EV as a medium speed DCFC can charge more than one car in a 4-8 hour period.

BTW I can list all of the counter arguments too:

1. It cost too much. Addressed in point 1 above.

2. It charges too slow. It's not a replacement for ultra high speed DCFC for long distance travel. It's a replacement for public L2 which point #2 addresses the speed difference.

3. There are not any out there. This is true, but not because they are not effective. I think there is a lack of awareness of their existence for than anything else. Coupled with slightly higher installation costs, a lot of businesses shy away.

If we could get every strip mall, big box, gym, apartment/condo, workplaces and standalone restaurant to install 1-4 of these units to create the access, a significant amount of the problems we have with people who cannot charge at home easily would have a lot more options.

m04og5a,Oosbie,"It doesn't matter if it's 3p, 1p, or one or two legs of 3p service.  Residential service is generally straightforward: You pay per unit energy, possibly with either a minimum fee or in addition to a fixed service charge.

Commercial tariffs and demand charge computation is significantly more complicated and are usually several times as many pages.  The short version is that you a lot pay per unit power (kW) as well as a bit per unit energy (kWh).  Small businesses are sometimes on a legacy account under residential tariff service, and usually either a specific commercial tariff or a general tariff with demand charges and possibly time of use rates.

Because you're billed (heavily) per unit power, especially at peak times, adding an extra 50-100 kVA (=kW at 1.00 PF) can be a lot of money even if it's only for 20 minutes.

m04d41v,straightdge,">how is Apple gonna be able to take part of their supply chain out of China

The moment CCP sees that Apple is moving it's operations away from China, they will likely to levy huge tariffs or outright ban Apple. 

Apple makes [$30 billion](https://i.imgur.com/J7Fmkgq.png) operating profit from China, per year. They sell about 45 million iPhones annually within China. The GVA per iPhone for iPhone assembled within china is only about $40-$45 per unit. So for every iPhone Chinese buy, they essentially generate $600 profit for US. The Chinese are not getting much out of assembling the iPhone. 

Cons: Loss of low skill FATP roles, though some of them can be compensated by Huawei or other domestic manufacturer taking up the share from iPhone.

Pros: The entire profit and the supply chain can remain within China, thus providing more funding for their development. eg., Huawei Mate series sources all of its key components (SoC, memory, OLED, camera) from domestic sources. Even the chips are fabricated at SMIC (all thanks to sanctions by US). Losing on $30 billion of operating profit for Apple can be irreversible.",1733184323.0,1,apple gon na able take part supply chain china moment ccp see apple moving operation away china likely levy huge tariff outright ban apple apple make 30 billion operating profit china per year sell 45 million iphones annually within china gva per iphone iphone assembled within china 4045 per unit every iphone chinese buy essentially generate 600 profit u chinese getting much assembling iphone con loss low skill fatp role though compensated huawei domestic manufacturer taking share iphone pro entire profit supply chain remain within china thus providing funding development eg huawei mate series source key component soc memory oled camera domestic source even chip fabricated smic thanks sanction u losing 30 billion operating profit apple irreversible

they aren't great conductors, just better than humans. But they are intentionally conductive.

AI's addition:

Modern tires are less conductive than in the past because manufacturers have reduced the amount of carbon black in rubber compounds to reduce weight and rolling resistance. This can lead to a build-up of static electricity in the car, which can be a problem when exiting the vehicle or refueling. To address this, tire engineers have designed tires with grounding strips or antenna treads. These are thin strips of rubber with a special compound that provides a path for conductance between the tire and the road. ",1733183963.0,18,car tire actually intentionally conductive prevent onlt conductor getting car arent great conductor better human intentionally conductive ai addition modern tire less conductive past manufacturer reduced amount carbon black rubber compound reduce weight rolling resistance lead buildup static electricity car problem exiting vehicle refueling address tire engineer designed tire grounding strip antenna tread thin strip rubber special compound provides path conductance tire road

Literally, a vehicle 'ground' does not exist. Because there is no ground. There is 0v.

m045wkv,RuffyUzumakii,"As far as I know from past numbers in Germany, many brands declare cars ""sold to dealers"" as ""cars sold"". So for example when big subsidies ended in the end a year, suddendly many brands hat a lot of sales because they tried to register the car to get the subdisides. But the cars weren't sold to customers, but yes to the dealerships that then got the option to sell them to real customers with their own deals and discounts. Whereas Tesla has no dealers, so every sold car was a direct sale to a real customer.

I can imagine seing many sudden sales from non-EV car models in december, since they try to register every car before they are not anymore allowed to sell them as ""new registration"" in 2025.",1733181720.0,2,far know past number germany many brand declare car sold dealer car sold example big subsidy ended end year suddendly many brand hat lot sale tried register car get subdisides car werent sold customer yes dealership got option sell real customer deal discount whereas tesla dealer every sold car direct sale real customer imagine seing many sudden sale nonev car model december since try register every car anymore allowed sell new registration 2025
