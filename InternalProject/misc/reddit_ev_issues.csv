"Why I, a prospective EV buyer, am not buying an EV (right now)","There’s been a lot of posts, articles, and analyses recently about EV sales climbing and yet EVs piling up on dealerships. I have seen a lot of analyses that resonate with me, and a lot that don’t. As somebody in the market for an EV but has yet to pull the trigger I thought it’d be helpful to list what is driving me to buy an EV and yet holding me back.

**Drives:** My wife’s car that we’ve had for 18 years is finally on its last legs. Being that we tend to keep our cars for a long time, we realize that in 10 years we really don’t want to be driving a gas vehicle. We also don’t want to be dealing with dual-powertrains, so a PHEV is something we’d also rather avoid if possible. One of the things I love about EVs is the simplicity of the drive train and minimal maintenance, and a PHEV brings all the baggage of ICE. At this point we feel that EV technology is mature enough and range long enough that we can justify getting a 250-ish+ range EV as her next car. Also, the 8+ year/100k mile warranties on most EVs elminate most concerns I have about the new technology. However, there are three things still holding us back: cost, NACS, and variety (this being the clincher).

**COST:** We’ve reached a point in both of our careers that money isn’t really an issue in buying a mainstream EV. However, just because we CAN afford a $50k Ioniq 5, doesn’t mean that we WANT to. The EV credits definitely help make the purchase more digestible, but the costs are still a significant deterrent. It will easily be the most expensive car we’ve ever bought, which as of today is my Tacoma that we bought new for $32k.

**NACS:** The announced transition to NACS from all of the major manufacturers also gives us pause. This is not a HUGE issue since we can just do L2 charging at home, but again, we keep our vehicles for a very long time. We also move every few years, so it’s hard to know if home/L2 charging will be a guarantee for us. In 3 years using a CCS adapter at L3 chargers may not be a problem. However, will that still be true 10 years from now? Right now there’s enough questions about the longevity of CCS and the adapters that we are more willing to wait. Especially with NACS being so close.

**Variety:** This really is the biggest one and is compounded by the cost and NACS transition. Because we keep our vehicles for so long, my wife really wants to love whatever her next vehicle is. On the ICE side there are a ton of vehicles that she thinks that she would like. On the EV side there are only a handful of options, none of which she was really enamored with. The Ioniq 5 was fine. The EV6 was fine. The Kona was fine. The Mach-E was…. Also fine. She just wasn’t crazy about any of them. If I’m going to pay more than normal for a vehicle, she needs to really like it. And if she is going to pay more than normal for a vehicle, then questions about NACS/CCS/etc. are not things that she really wants to deal with. Is she being picky about her next vehicle? Yes. But at that price, and her first car purchase in 18 years, I think it’s warranted. There are a lot of new cars coming in the next 12-24 months, and we are willing to wait to see if any of those stand out. I saw a CNBC report about EVs piling up, and they mentioned the “TV” effect, where every year a new TV comes out that’s better than the last one and it is cheaper than the previous year. I feel that same way when shopping for EVs right now.

**Overall** I am stoked for the EV transition and am disappointed that there aren’t any on the market today that my wife really loves (I’d totally get an Ioniq 5 if she loved it). So, for now, we’re going to keep waiting. I ended up buying a used Honda Fit from a friend to hold us over for another year or two while we wait. If any car dealerships are reading this, I hope it’s helpful seeing the mindset of an eager but reluctant customer.

Edit: I appreciate all the great conversations folks engaged in today. In case I failed to get my point across, cost and NACS are factors, but not really THE factors. When I started shopping I had resigned myself to the fact that NACS adapters would probably be fine, and that the cost would be worth it if we really loved the vehicle and had a great ownership experience. The bigger issue is that with the cars on the market, we just didn't really find one that we loved, and not NEEDING to buy a new vehicle, have chosen to wait until the market has more options. That's an entirely SUBJECTIVE issue for my wife and I, but not really a critique of EVs in general. I don't know how common this is for other shoppers as ""EVs pile up at dealerships"", but thought it was worth sharing. I still strongly recommend EVs to others and do my best to diminish fears people may have about range anxiety, battery degradation, insert\_low\_effort\_EV\_criticism\_here.

I of course agree that we need a much broader variety of styles and price points in the EV market, and fortunately we’ve already started to see a lot of progress toward that point. I bought the first of three first-gen Leafs that I’ve owned in 2015, and my first long-range EV in 2022, a Model Y. What a difference seven years makes. I look forward to buying an electric van or small pickup in the years to come.\n\nAlso, and obviously, I lied about the Halloween candy I bought for the neighborhood children. I’ve already eaten like half the KitKats.', 'Perspective from someone who bought a Model 3 this year in part because of the FUD around the NACS transition:  My partner and I are replacing our other ICE car with a Bolt EUV.  The only regret I have with the Tesla is that I didn’t buy it sooner, it was pretty much exactly what we were looking for to replace the first car, but I’m 100% **not** worried about the transition after having an EV for a while\n\nCCS1 is on all non-tesla BEVs in the wild in the US (except the leaf because nissan is nissan), and will be for at least the next two model years.  NACS and CCS also use the same signaling protocols, so dumb adapters will work for both regardless, it’s such a small change that I’d honestly be surprised if there **weren’t** aftermarket conversions for most cars from CCS1 to NACS ports within 5 years, possibly even OEM ones.  Between this, and how rarely DCFC is actually needed, I’m not at all concerned about the long-term support.  If anything, DCFC has been a bigger issue for owners of older Teslas which use the same NACS port, but don’t use the CCS signaling protocol (and people have been able to upgrade them to speak CCS)\n\nI agree that a PHEV powertrain isn’t ideal next to BEVs both due to maintenance and complexity, which is the main reason we went with a BEV instead of a hybrid.  However, almost all of the issues with hybrids are the same ones you’d get with an ICE vehicle, so I’d still take a hybrid over any ICE vehicle, especially since most qualify for the same tax credits as BEVs\n\nIf you find an EV that meets your needs now, there’s absolutely no reason to think it won’t meet your needs 10+ years from now (except maybe the leaf, again because nissan)', ""For me it's all about form factor and cost. I want a AWD van or truck, and in the $40-60k ballpark. **I do not want a SUV.** \n\nThere are 3 van options: an e-Transit with horrible range, an eSprinter that is only RWD, or stealing one from an Amazon driver (I've thought about this one a lot).\n\nThere are 2 truck options: a Rivian which is beyond my budget, and a Lightning which is just barely in the budget, but unavailable in those trims.\n\nI've got some time, but I'd like to buy something in the next 6 months. My preferred option, the VW [id.buzz](https://id.buzz) is looking less and less likely to deliver in that window."", 'First off, I strongly urge you to buy (or not buy) whatever car you want - these are just some different ways of thinking about it. \n\nBut for me, also a person who has kept cars for many years, the logic was different. Getting a car I like - same. However, I looked at my prior vehicle’s 180k miles, and thought, that’s a ton of gas savings. If I’m going to keep a car for decades, and I’m at a point in my life where liquidity isn’t a problem, than an EV starts to look really good, even with an upfront premium. \n\nAlso, it seems clear from how the announcements have gone that CCS cars will be able to plug into NACS chargers with an adapter. Given how little charging is done on the road, I wouldn’t be too worried about that. \n\nThat all said, the variety and price are sure to improve with time, so if you can wait a few years, I’m sure you’ll be happy with the options available.', 'I’m just waiting on the new Volvo. Maybe your wife would like one of the EVs that are slated to come out in the next year. No harm in waiting a bit until you find something you really like.', ""I am where you are in terms of having a hard time justifying the expense and not being blown away enough by any of the cars to pay $50-60k.  I will say, of the cars I drove, which included the Hyundais, EV6 and Ford, I really liked the BMW i4 the most and it was easier to consider spending that kind of money for a BMW since they are always expensive.  It had a lot of actual controls and felt like driving a regular car and a very nice one at that.  We thought about leasing it to get the $7500 tax credit and because of the potential for tech changes.  In the end, I just can't bring myself to sign up for a car payment, especially that high of one.  But I didn't see that model mentioned in your post so I thought I would throw it out there since it sounds like your wife likes a lot of the same things in a car that I do."", 'I agree with your personal analysis and will throw in another thing to consider. Repairability. Being able to have diagnostic tools and parts. The model 3 had a solenoid problem that would freeze in the winter and cause miss reading sensor, disabling the heat pump. They fixed it eventually with a software fix that ignores that sensors input. \n\nBut a 50 dollar part not being readily available or the independent repair network not having tools and schematics to fix your car. \n\nIn the US I view vehicles as an industrial tool. The second biggest expense next to your domicile. With that I NEED be able to repair it. Yes the simplicity of the power train makes it less likely for mechanical failure. Well guess what there’s a plethora of other components on that vehicle. My Tacoma has been solid with regular maintenance hoping to take it to 300k. But with it I’ve cracked a rear brake light because I hit something. I bought a new light case off eBay switched it out. \n\nI just saw a YouTube video repair of a conventional ICE high end F150 width msrp of 80k have its traffic proximity sensors repaired. It was a 5k price because the parts were 2k a each plus labor. Yes 5k to replace poorly engineered sensors. But it was an available part. \n\nI don’t think you’ll get those sensors for an EV.

What I do know is that, in my opinion, the general cabin quality of EVs and their comparably priced ICE vehicles are not the same.

2014 Ford Focus Electric - 3 months owning it,"Hello everyone,

I understand there is a great many people out there who are not sure about electric cars, what it takes to own one, and the problems one might encounter. I am writing this to share my personal experience over the last three months of owning an electric car. Think of this mostly as food for thought. I'm not trying to force anyone in to buying one, simply diving in to my own thought process behind my purchase in hopes that it will help shed light on to the subject.

Six months ago, after reviewing my monthly gas bill I decided I wanted to look in to the logistics of buying an electric car with the overall goal of reducing my gas bill. I have always thought highly of electric cars mostly due to my interest in everything computerie, ever since I saw the advertisements for the EV1 as a kid.  I first thought that there would be a great many factors to consider, however after boiling it all down I discovered what I call ""Cost to Operate"", which can be applied to any vehicle and consists of the following:

1. Loan payments
2. Gas
3. Insurance

While this does not include yearly maintenance costs, it still gave me enough information to start a comparison, set a budget, and eventually proceed with the purchase. First I considered my current car, a 2007 Toyota Tacoma. Cost to operate was an even $700/month, with $300 of that being gas. Considering my recreational choices I will still need the truck from time to time, which means I would not consider trading it in at this time.

Assuming I can reduce my gas bill down to $0, that leaves a budget of $300 to fit an electric car in to. This was a little tight, however after a few months of research I managed to find a car the fit my needs:

* 2014 Ford Focus Electric
* Sticker Price: $8,998
* Miles: 46k
* Range: 75 miles
* Battery life: 90% life remaining (so like 60-70 mile range depending on a great many factors)
* Taxes/Fees/DealershipBullShittery: $1500

My initial estimate suggested id be at around $300 a month to own this car, which was loosely confirmed after getting a loan approval from my bank, and an initial estimate from my insurance carrier. Once I had solid enough numbers I went to the dealership and made my purchase. After three months of owning this car I can now confirm the monthly cost to operate (which assumes I only charge during the most expensive time of day) at being: $290. Realistically i'm looking at between $250-$275 / month. Of that only $120 is my monthly loan payments.

The math behind my power usage took a bit of research, but this is  what I came up with:

* \- Guessing at a charging efficiency of 80% (Likely slightly better, won't know until I get a charging station)
* \- Assuming I have to fully recharge the 23kwh battery every day (Which I don't)
* \- Assuming I can only recharge during the most expensive time of day (Which is almost never the case)
* = Total cost per month to charge: $60.
* = Realistically: My average power bill has not gone up more than $30/$40 a month.

Overall, by purchasing this car, and not driving my truck my total monthly bills have gone down by around $50. And I get to keep my truck for when I want to hit the sand dunes. All in all considered, I am pretty happy with this car, with a few things to note about it.

Three months of driving my Ford Focus Electric, what disadvantages have I noticed? What issues have I ran in to? What unexpected costs popped up? Below is a list of things I'd consider to be note worthy in the ""disadvantages"" category, however not a single one of these would have been a deal breaker had I known about it before making my purchase.

* \- a tire keeps going flat every month or so. Very slow leak. I have not cared enough to look in to this yet.
* \- Recently a warning sign, ""Pull over safely now"" followed by power being cut from motor started happening. I took the car to the dealership who reported a faulty PCM wiring harness. Repair cost: $800. Had I purchased the extended warranty from the dealership this issue would have been fully covered, however that warranty costs $1500, so all in all my decision to decline that coverage is still saving me some money....for now. If I continue to experience issues with this car (repairs exceeding its value) I plan on converting it's battery and power management system in to a power wall for my house, and re-purposing its drive system for my off road vehicles. At least, if possible and if it makes sense. Hopefully I don't need to explore this option any time soon.
* \- Range anxiety: struggle is real. Each and every time I use this car for non-work related commuting I have to take in to consideration the range and availability of charging stations should I need them. While I have intentionally tested its range on special adventures, for my normal day-to-day errands this car has worked just fine. Round trip commute is 42 miles. Most of the time I run my AC on one way or the other. On days I work I can't really deviate from my normal commute that much, or even stay that late at work, as I arrive home with about 25% left in the tank. Typically the car reaches 100% charge about an hour before I leave for work in the morning. This issue will be fixed once I have a level 2 charging station installed at home, or at work. For now I am limited to the 110v level 1 charger that came with the car, which stays at home.
*\- small battery in this model.
* \- very slow 0-15mph time. I really can't peel out if I wanted to from a dead stop, but once it gets going you can really feel the acceleration.
* \- not a speed deamon. Max speed: 84mph, which appears to be a software limit. I can feel it accelerating until it hits 84mph, at which point it simply maintains that speed. I might be able to reprogram the computer to allow me to go faster, however I hesitate to do so until I have done enough research on the electric motor and what it can safely handle.
* \- This is not a truck. It has much smaller tires which means I need to be more mindful of bumps i'd otherwise just drive over at top speed in my Tacoma. Lower to ground than the truck, can't see over/around cars in-front of me. Pretty limited visibility all around, but not a deal breaker.
* \- This car is limited to level 1 or 2 charging, no level 3 or ""fast Charging"". Still only a theoretically 4 hours to fully charge on level 2. I mostly only charge it at home on a level 1 (110v, 12A) charger, which takes a good 14 hours to fully charge from the day's commute. There is a charging station near my office, however its a pain to get to and is often full.
* At home charging: The charger that came with the car will require its own dedicated breaker, meaning any outlet I plug it in to can't really have anything else sharing the same breaker without risk of tripping it. i figured this out the hard way. The previous owners of my house saw fit to bless me with a dedicated 20A exterior outlet which is close enough to my driveway to use. Not having a garage has been annoying, but this outlet made it all work. I plan on installing a dedicated 240v 40A line for a charging station for which I have received estimates of around $1500 to have this done by an electrician. Will take me many months of savings before I can explore this option any further.

With all that being said, there are a few things I have noticed about this car which is better than my Tacoma:

* \-  Smoother ride, like a luxury car. Very nice to drive, handles very well.
* \-  No vibrations while sitting still. Glides over the road like butter when moving.
* \-  almost no lag from gas peddle to acceleration
* \-  no need to stop by gas stations, unless I want a snack.
* \-  Cost to charge at home really isn't that bad. $30 - $40 a month.
*\- Had to change driving habits to help preserve battery. I think if this as a good thing. No more jack rabbit starts, slow acceleration and deceleration is best.

All in all I do not regret buying this car. Over the last three months I have thoroughly enjoyed driving it around. Given its price I don't think I would have chosen a different car if I could go back and try again. According to my math it will take about 3.5 years of usage before I break even in terms of gas savings vs cost of car. With that in mind I have a plan for the future: I am going to pay off this car as soon as I can, likely making huge monthly payments when I am able. I still owe quite a bit for my Tacoma as well, so I plan on fully paying that off in the same manor. Once both cars are payed off I will then be saving up a huge chunk of change. In 3 or 5 years I will trade in my Tacoma and FFE + cash for an electric truck, either Rivian, Tesla, F150, or whatever else might come out between now and then.",37,"['Good plan! Thank you for sharing your experience!', 'Just FYI, a lot of cars can\'t actually charge at 240V/40A. Of course, running a new line, the cost difference is pretty minuscule for increased amperage. I was researching it and had people saying ""oh you can save money by doing a 30A line"" and it\'s like, we\'re looking at $150 in parts and $400 in labor for 50A versus $125 parts and $400 in labor for the 30A. not worth the savings. The 50A breaker is like three bucks more, the wire is like an extra 75 cents a foot, the receptacle is the same. As far as I can figure it, a 50A 6/3 circuit with a NEMA 14-50 is ideal for being able to run any EVSE you might want, and I wouldn\'t go less than that. \n\nOne thing you could do, if you *only* need that outlet for EV charging, is that you could get a 20A 2-pole breaker and swap the receptacle for a NEMA 6-20 (which looks like the normal plug except one of the flat prongs is horizontal instead of vertical). Household wiring doesn\'t care what the voltage is, only the amps. So your 120V/20A circuit is already wired in 12 ga wiring, which is fine for 240V as well. The only downside is that you would not be able to use any 120v stuff on that outlet, even with an adapter (there are certain outlets you can get that are combination 120/240 that you could hypothetically adapt to either, but you\'d need a 3 conductor wire which you probably don\'t have)', 'I personally wouldn\'t buy a ""short range"" EV without DC fast charging. \n\nIn my area the charging just isn\'t there, so my EV is a Range Extended EV.', 'We have a 2014 FFE as well, bought new in 2014 and now has 60,000 miles on it. I appreciate your detailed cost analysis; I didn\'t do anything like that before buying. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about little details on the car.\n\nOne correction -- the 23 kWh pack has buffers at the top & bottom of its range, so when you fully charge from 0-100% you\'ve actually only added about 18.5 kWh, or probably less considering your battery has some degradation.\n\nI think one of its best features is the way GPS works. If you preprogram your trip (up to 4 stops plus the last leg home) and tell it that you\'ll plug it in when you get home, it does an excellent job of showing you, as you drive around, how much extra range you have to make it home.\n\nThe dreaded ""Stop Safely Now"" error has plagued a lot of owners\' otherwise very good experiences with the FFE. I had it happen several times last year, and this year the dealership finally replaced my battery pack under warranty.', 'True, but he still has the ICE truck for long trips.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/d81nlj/2014_ford_focus_electric_3_months_owning_it/

There's a hell of a lot more to it than that. Businesses absolutely do spend a million on things that generate a 10% ROI each year. That's kinda the point in fixed assets - there's virtually no fixed assets you can invest in that'll turn around and produce revenue of the same amount in the first year of operation. A fixed asset is an asset you've got that you expect to bring future economic benefit to you.

You spread it across the lifetime of 10 years, so from an accounting perspective, that 1m spend breaks even each year from a P&L perspective. 100k depreciation (expenditure), 100k net income = 0, break-even. When a business is trying to grow, breaking even on that investment is great - a lot of businesses choose to make losses. Because there's the time value of money to consider, as well as forecasting.

Not to mention the rollout aspect. With fewer chargers out there initially, less people are going to interact with them. We're now getting to a stage of pretty decent EA coverage so more people are using them. Not to mention the increase in charging rates for various EV models. Newer models with higher rates people are going to be more aware that a station may be derated than something like a Bolt for example and raise a stink about it.\n\nI've never attributed EA's issues purely to malice, but merely an 'early adopter'/infancy problem.

It is a short drive to Pasadena, which has charging stations with many Level 2 chargers and several dozen DC chargers at some locations, many of which are owned by Pasadena Water and Power. The same is true for Glendale, which, again, has its own power company and has built out multiple stations or encouraged multiple stations to be built. While this won't help the people like the lady mentioned who lives right there and can't charge at home, folks traveling through the San Gabriel Valley area have plenty to choose from.\n\nI still think we need more chargers everywhere so folks don't have to wait in long lines, I am glad he brought attention to this issue.\n\nEdit: Note confirmed that SCE provides infrastructure at this location via the Verdugo 16K circuit.

"The whole NACS certification and adoption will do nothing to ""solve"" the public charging problem....","Multi EV owner here....    Also, an exhausted consumer of public charging that literally never works.  At dozens of charge stations of probably every charge network I've tried, it just never works, especially in the winter.

The Plug or voltage will do NOTHING to solve the broader charging problem.  Its profoundly naïve to believe that it will affect anything.  Plenty of internet dweebs that are either Tesla shills that think they have ""won"" or others who know nothing about the why public charging is so bad might think there is a silver bullet, but there simply isn't.  Sure, I'd like a smaller plug for fast charging, but it still won't do a damn thing because its not the source of the problems.

Yes, Tesla did a great job building an integrated singular system to charge their cars, They are also really good at maintaining their own equipment..  But for charging to work more broadly across likely billions of cars and multiple OEMs in the next century, the entire process needs profound simplification.

Our species knows how to plug things in and move voltage and current over wires.  We've been doing it for nearly 150 years with little fanfare.   My home charging works perfectly every.... single.... time.  The basic hardware works 100% of the time (we have a Ford, Emporia, and Grizzl-E chargers).   There are plenty of physical plugs used around the Earth in different countries, but they all move voltage exactly the same way.  Not one is better than any other.

Its all the software and garbage that the charging and car companies have encumbered the charging process with.  All the junky ""apps"", the wildly unreliable payment systems, the touch screens, the ""Plug and charge"" ideology, the obsession to use phones for literally everything, the handshaking protocols, and all the trash we've surrounded the basics of charging with have made this whole public charging process a folly.   Its a software debacle, and a shameful display of stupidity by otherwise well intentioned people.

But in nearly all cases, its the inability to enable the  basic charging hardware to move voltage to my cars.  All the crap required to just turn on the charger and start the flow of electricity is what breaks.  And unfortunately, having participated in many standards bodies over the years, those are the last places to solve these problems, as they move at a glacial pace.  And even if some standards bodies weigh in on these non hardware problems, it could take decades before things change....

That is probably NEVI\'s biggest failing, requiring 4x 150kW with 600kW site power rather than 4x 350kW with 600kW site power and power sharing.  They are going to be chargers of last resort now.  Of course the plug solves a lot of it too because 0kW is really slow.\n\n> the entire process needs profound simplification.\n\nI agree but NACS is a path there.  It is protocol agnostic and will support both the CCS protocol and Tesla\'s initially.  Tesla\'s protocol is greatly simplified by their use of CAN.  The is a widely used way to communicate across wires and used by every car manufacture on earth.  This solves the transport part of communication.  CCS built it\'s own transport and it\'s terrible.  Not saying Tesla\'s doesn\'t have it\'s issues, but protocols can be added on going forward.  While NACS doesn\'t spec any of this, hopefully soon someone will release a standard going forward.

The ""wire"" as you call it is many times thinner and lighter which puts many times less stress on the plug and the port.  You probably have it inside or you live in a moderate climate so the wire doesn\'t freeze up and get stiff.  You don\'t need to do a transaction to pay yourself for the electricity which simplifies things greatly. So basically it\'s nothing alike to public charging.\n\n> Its all the software and garbage that the charging and car companies have encumbered the charging process with.\n\nSo you\'re anti-CCS?  It\'s not like Tesla is having problem with their software and garbage.  You have to exchange money and you have to regulate voltage between the car and the charger.  There is going to be some amount of garbage there.  The cables have to be cooled so there are sensors and communications, you can\'t get around that.  You can\'t compare charging at 9kW in your garage to 350kW at a public charger and expect them to be the same level of simplicity.  \n\nYou seem to suggest we don\'t take payment and just have live 350kW plugs hanging around for someone to stick a fork into?\n\n\n> having participated in many standards bodies over the years, those are the last places to solve these problems\n\nSo you are pro NACS then which was not built by standards bodies?

When you charge at home, you're actually feeding AC to the charger in your car, which converts it to DC and charges up the battery.  It's able to accept a wide range of voltages and currents and it talks to the battery management system, so pretty much everything happens inside the car and all is good.  \n\nThe on-board charger in your car cannot handle high-power charging however.  Most top out at 11kW, with some being capable of 22kW.  So when you're fast charging, the charger is essentially connected directly to the battery, bypassing the onboard charger.  It sends DC directly to the battery and as a result, the car's battery management system needs to be able to communicate with the charger to tell it what current to send, what the state of charge, when to stop, etc.  That is not possible with some software implementation, and that is where troubles often occur.\n\nTesla mostly solved this by using the same charger modules in their superchargers as they use in the cars themselves, just with more in parallel to increase capacity.  So whether the car is talking to its internal charger or to a supercharger, it's pretty much the same. Hopefully with NACS now adopted as an SAE standard, all cars will be like that and it'll solve the problem.\n\nTo be honest however, I've rarely encountered a DC charger that flat out did not work unless there was an issue with the local transformer and they had no power coming in.  The most common issue I see is with 150+ kW stations where the cable cooling system has failed and they derate to 100A, which is about 40 kW on most cars.

I never even implied anything about Tesla, positive or negative, just that the fanbois always pounce, defend, etc.  Its just weird to love a product company so much....   \n\nI don't agree though that we need plug and charge.  Its nice for sure, and some EA stations do that on my Lightning (if the station is actually working!)   It could be fine if it was 100% reliable, but a heterogeneous population of a billion EVs made by 100 different manufacturers will make that wildly impractical.  Standards are standards but don't need to be followed by any OEM, they are just recommendations in most cases.  This is exactly the case with OBD2 today.  The minimal OBD for emissions monitoring requirements are met, but everything else is whatever the OEM decides.   Same with CANBus and how you talk to all the controllers and what you can access.  Its the wild west for sure.\n\nAnd I know that electricity doesn't just flow, I'm using it as a metaphor.  To the regular consumer, it should just flow, like gasoline does.  No fuss, no drama.

This is a problem of the car, not of the charger. \n\n(On top of that, there is also an incompatibility problem, causing Kia and Hyundai to get only 45 kW at Tesla v3 chargers. That could both be a Tesla problem and a Kia/Hyundai problem.

What I suck at is estimating the number of EVs so I'll spell out the math and you can plug in your guess.\n\nCurrently ~3m EVs on the road today.  By 2030 there is the crazily optimistic goal that we get to 50% of new car sales.  I'm  in more of the 30% of new car sales range so I'll go with that.  We've only been selling 14m cars/year for the past 3 years so I'll stick with that but it could easily jump to 17m+ at some point.  That would add ~22m EVs to the road for a nice round 25m EVs total. \n\nAt an average of 2,000 miles/year on public DCFC that would be 50B miles of charging needed in 2030. A charger can deliver about 140kWh * 4 miles/kWh = 560 miles of range per hour.  Assuming it only does this for 12 hours/day of utilization then you would need 90k DCFC chargers by 2030. Call it a round 100k because you can't perfectly distribute charging needs. \n\nTesla has been doubling their number of chargers every ~18 months so they have the time to double 4x before 2030.

I’m just going to say it: 90% of you aren’t going to keep your EVs long enough to worry about extending your batteries’ healths this much. ,"Very, very few people keep their cars long enough that anyone should be considerably worried about their battery’s longevity.

Cars are tools used to enrich aspects of your life. Treat them as such and stop stressing about SoH so much.

Edit: commenters’ reading comprehension is not looking great.

Edit 2: since no one wants to really read I’ll explain it: I bought a used 2019 Leaf S with ~6k miles on it, 40kWh battery. I opportunity charge at home and work, put around 175 miles on it per week. Granted I don’t really fast charge, but my car isn’t really designed to do this often like many of ya’lls cars do. With very little consideration I have managed to go from 100% SoH to 86% (just checked LeafSpy) in four years and 50k miles. I will drive this car in to the ground. If I hit the SoH until it was 50% it would STILL serve my uses. That may be in 7-8 more years from now bringing its total life span to 13 years. This car will have gotten me to work and made me so much money in 13 years I’ll hardly care what a dealer will give me for it.

I think it might be 90% of the actual capacity when it shows ""100%"" on the dashboard.\n\nSecondly, the car won\'t sit on that 90% if it\'s driven every day.  Once one uses the car in the morning, say to drive to work, it will use 10% to 20% of the capacity, then sit for 8 or 10 hours at a state of charge of something under, oh, 75% actual state of charge.  Drive home, and we\'re even less. An average American car gets driven about 13,000 miles a year, or a little over 1000 miles a month.  Call it 35 miles a day, if you like.  That\'s about, what? 10 kWh per day of electricity used. \n\nSo the ""daily charge cycle"" of that battery might be 25% of the total?  If one has a larger battery or drives a bit less, we\'re talking about one full charge cycle a week or so. Yeah, it\'s in small increments due to a daily charge, but battery degradation estimates are based on ""full cycles"" not how many charge sessions one has.\n\nMy 2013 Nissan Leaf, with a small, 24 kWh battery and no thermal management system was charged to 100% daily, used at more like 40% - 50% capacity each and every day for a decade, more than 3500 charge cycles, before it was totaled in an accident.  It still had over 80% capacity left on the battery when it was totaled.  Today\'s EVs, with better chemistry, much larger batteries, better thermal management, etc. should lose battery capacity at a much lower rate than mine did. I\'d expect a modern, 60 kWh battery to degrade at a third, maybe a quarter of the rate mine did, even without limiting the daily charge to under 100% of the dashboard charge capacity. The average ICE vehicle stays on the road for 12 years. A modern EV with a modern NMC Li-ion battery should last twice that, easy.\n\nAn LFP battery, which already should have a much lower capacity loss rate than an NMC chemistry should last a LOT longer.

But I\'m going to assume it\'s LFP.\n\nThe reason you want to charge an LFP battery up to 100% periodically is because it\'s required for the BMC to be able to properly determine the SoC of your battery.\n\nOn an NMC battery, you can make a fairly accurate determination of the SoC by just looking at the voltage, so this periodic charging to 100% is not needed for the same reason.\n\nOn LFP isn\'t not that simple, because the battery stays at the same voltage for a big part of the SoC curve, so the only way it can determine the SoC is to measure how much energy goes in to the battery vs how much goes out and keep a tally. Over time, that\'ll get less and less accurate, and a charge to 100% is needed to reset the counters and make them accurate again.\n\nThe reason you don\'t want to leave your car sitting above 80%, especially when it\'s hot, is the concern for battery degradation that can occur more rapidly in these cases.\n\nThe optimal thing you can do in your case is to try to time charging 100% only before you know you\'re going to be using the car soon, and preferably using at least 20% of your battery on that trip, because that\'ll satisfy both recommendations as well as possible. And only charging to 100% once a week, or when you know you\'re going to need it.\n\nBasically you can boil this down to these three recommendations, in order of priority.\n\n* Try to minimize the period of time your car stays at 100%, i.e. don\'t charge to 100% daily unless you need it, and don\'t charge the car to 100% if you intend not to drive it for a few days. Better charge it the day before.\n* Do not charge to 100% if you plan on leaving your car unused for a while. Ideally, keep it closer to 50% SoC, since that\'ll be fine regardless of temperature.\n* Charge to 100% once a week to maintain the optimal functioning of the SoC measurement.\n\nThat said, if we go in the spirit of the OP here, the point of a car is for it to be used. You should ignore any of these recommendations above if they get in the way of how you intend to use your car. If you need the range, absolutely charge to 100% when you need to. That\'s what the battery\'s for.\n\nYou shouldn\'t bend over backwards to try to follow this kind of charging regime, but try to find a way to get as close to it as possible without inconveniencing yourself.\n\nThere are plenty of stories out there with batteries with high mileages that have survived just fine despite suboptimal management. And nobody really knows how batteries manufactured today will hold up in the long run, and how important these practices are.', 'Follow the recommendation of charging to 100% every week, even if it is hot or if it means that the car is left at 100% for a while.\n\nYou should avoid doing the things that wear the battery whenever you can do so without loss of convenience, but you should not be afraid of doing those things when you need to.', ""Point 2 is don't leave it sitting at 100. Time your 100% charges to finish an hour before you need the car, and wear will be minimal."", ""I don't know why Hyundai make that recommendation, this isn't something that is recommended for NMC batteries in general. It's possible that they just use the same recommendation for all cars no matter the chemistry, rather than having to burden their customers with having know what battery chemistry they have.

Assuming everything goes well with it.', 'I guess I don’t understand the connection you are making. My intended point was that while\nOP is technically correct that, based solely on economic self interest for people who own a car for a relatively short period of time, mindful battery care won’t make a big difference to their  bottom line, a purely economic framing will lead to overall harm. It’s the same argument as “people shouldn’t bother to wash dishes when styrofoam plates are so cheap”. Arguing that we should consider the broader moral considerations not just economics in decisions.\n\nMy only point in bringing up people who can afford new EVs is that they are on the wealthier side and even less likely to be meaningfully impacted by the economics of being gentle with the battery.

There are many ways the actual wear can be masked (Reducing buffers over time, or simply using idirect measurements). The gold standard is to do a full 100%-0% discharge cycle and measure the actual energy contained in the cell, which the car certanly is not doing on it's own accord.\n\nAs for how you use the car: Do you actually charge to 100% daily or do you charge to 100% less frequently: How far do you discharge between charges?

Compounded over several years this leads to uselessness within the timeframe I cited. A highly degraded cell would be expected to have a higher risk of total failure so I would not expect a simple gradual fade to 0%. Usually a cell with 30% degradation is considered EOL. This can likely be stretched but probably not reliably.\n\nThis has nothing at all to do with how fast you charge the cells, this has everything to do with storage conditions. In fact most modern EVs will be very hard pressed to ever wear out their cells from cycling wear (I.e. charging), calendar wear (I.e. storage conditions) is pretty much the only thing that matters. To reach the limit on cycling wear modern cars will need to drive 400 000-1000 000 km, which is way more than most cars will do before they are mechanically worn out.\n\nWhen you charge to 100% on a daily basis the cells will for most users spend nearly all their time at an elevated SOC so calendar wear accumulates quickly.\n\nAllowing the cells to spend most of their time below 60% SOC would extend the life of the cell.', 'For LFP it does cause it degrade faster as well, but LFP also has a longer lifespan so most automakers say its fine if its LFP because its factored into the lifespan estimates. Its also for SOC accuracy.', 'Yes it is. The guideline to charge LFP cells to 100% regularly is there to calibrate the BMS so capacity measurement can remain accurate. It is not there to preserve the cells.

The short range and slow charging of the Leaf made it a terrible EV, and so many ICEholes still think EVs go under 100 miles and then take several hours to charge.\n\nBesides, what if you need to charge, can't charge at home, but also don't need to do any shopping, and don't feel like eating out? You're gonna need that fast charging."", 'Sure but then you can try to recoup the revenue loss by e.g., increasing the fee per kWh', ""One of the gas station chains in my country installs only 50KW chargers, probably exactly for this reason. (and they're cheaper too!)"", ""Competition is what kills the 50kW locations.  NEVI funded locations are 150kW minimum, so there'll be a bunch of 150kW minimum competition.  Nobody (other than maybe some Bolts) will stop at a 50kW location when there's 150kW+ location down the road."", ""I'll still use that 50kW charger, but then I'm in a Bolt EV so it makes no difference to me.\n\nPretty sure once we have a faster charging EV we'll prefer the fastest charging we can find, or at least fastest enough to get to 80% while we stop. I wont be the only one, so that very likely will encourage the higher kW chargers (maybe not every charger at stop, but there will be some). Plus it is a numbers game, and anything that encourages repeat stops is a competitive advantage even when they don't stop for a meal every time."", ""Nobody sits down for an hour on a road trip, that's just not realistic.\n\nToday, if you don't have fast chargers, you're not getting traffic. People using level 3 are road tripping and want to keep moving. A 20 minute fast charge is still plenty of time to get a burger and you need that draw nearby to get people to stop at all. There's just not enough chargers out there right now; they're strategically placed to bridge the gaps and get you across long distances, so you really don't have many choices on where to stop. And since you're having to charge up to 80% to make the next gap, it really pays to concentrate business around those fast chargers and capture those stops.\n\nEventually, instead of a charger every 200 miles, infrastructure will build out to every 100 miles, then every 50 miles, etc. More EVs on the road should keep them busy, but if the next stop is full you can just keep going - you don't have to wait in line at the only option. But that's still predicated on fast charging being available - you won't stop for 50kW if there's 300kW just down the road. People are still driving to a destination.\n\nI think the places you might see 50kW charging come into play are highly populated areas, remote areas and day trip destinations. \n\nPopulated areas - I'm driving around LA with my friends and we want to grab some food but we're not on a strict timetable, so slow charging while we eat lunch might save me having to top up later to get home. I'm going to the mall for an hour, I'm going to Disneyland (even slower, you'll be there all day), etc.\n\nRemote areas - People still like getting out to the woods and mountains and there may not be enough demand to make fast charging profitable, or there may not be enough existing electrical infrastructure to support it. A tiny crossroads town in Wyoming isn't going to see enough traffic to justify a big charger expense if they even have enough power to run it, but if it's the only place to charge for 200 miles, some of the people that HAVE to go through there will stop rather than skip the journey/use alternative transport.\n\nDay trips - I'm picturing little roadside restaurants on PCH or Angeles Crest or Tail of the Dragon - places that already have existing traffic but aren't really on the way to anywhere. They don't need fast charging, but if you're already there with an EV so why not top up while you're taking a break?"", 'Most cars used on long trips charge at between 125 and 175kw roughly.

Problems with home charging,"Wondering if anyone can help. Just bought a 52kwh 2020 Renault Zoe, which I’m plugging into a 3 pin plug at home, going into a type 2 port in the vehicle.

I’ve tried plugging into 3 different plugs in the house and same thing happens. If I plug it in last thing at night then it will charge through the night until I switch something on in the morning.

I previously have a Nissan Leaf, which had a slightly different connector to the car, but was still plugging into a 3 pin plug. With this car, the electric would trip out when I initially plugged in it, but once I switched the electric back on I’d have no issue.

California wanting to force people into electric cars while a solid portion of the state can't reliably charge at home is crazy. \n\nI love my EV but if I had to rapid charge all the time there would be zero savings on gas so you would just have to really want the car."", ""That's my hope, that when I move, I'll be able to find a place that's within a reasonable walking distance from a charging station, so one day a week or so I can just drop the car off in the morning and then walk back to pick it up after lunch. I'd rather routinely keep it topped off (or 80-90 percent) than wait until the charge gets low.\n\nBased on my current driving habits I'm lucky if I drive 100 miles in a week, though for an EV to be my only car I would need something in the mid 200s in terms of range, as I would make the occasional long trip through somewhat of a charging desert and would need to make it to my destination in one go. A Bolt EUV would do me nicely in that case."", '\n\nOlder apartments — including Los Angeles’ famous dingbat buildings of the postwar period, a style found in other Sun Belt areas — often lack the electrical infrastructure to install chargers. Newer buildings are covered by state building code requirements to pre-wire 10 percent of parking spots so it will later be easier to install chargers. Retrofitting surface or garage parking can range from $2,000 to $10,000 per spot, and multifamily dwellings, especially small ones, don’t have a lot of parking to begin with, so EV-only spaces further crowd small lots or garages.\n\nSome advocate for more software and tech solutions to serve as a bridge and expand the charging potential of a limited number of plugs. Especially as EVs take off in Southern California, the increasing need for multiple chargers at every site will require tech to manage the energy load. Firms like EVMatch offer subscriptions services, so property owners can help more drivers utilize limited charging infrastructure. Chargie, which has installed chargers at hundreds of apartment buildings, offers load-management software to distribute and load-manage limited power bandwidth to multiple vehicles. Four chargers become 16, for instance, with vehicles slowly powering up overnight.\n\nOthers are testing additional technology solutions, including installing batteries and solar panels so building owners could theoretically offer charging without incurring steeper electricity costs. Chargie is testing this option in Los Angeles, one more potential innovation for a market that’s still in flux and running out of time.', 'Have you ever seen these in the wild?  I read about them before, but it seems like they haven’t been building out much.  Great concepts, but I wonder what their sales are like.\n\nEdit: reading more about then it looks like they are just another rent-seeking parasite with the same monthly charges as the other guys, but worse service and hardware.\n\nLandlords don’t want to absorb a monthly charge,  they will pass that in to the tenant, and the tenant will not want to pay extra cost to some 3rd party that removes the Economic incentive for the EV.\n\nYou need good hardware with good software and the ability to maintain everything yourself.

Not yet but we are cleared to operate there and working on potential partnerships \n\n2. Excellent question, the outlets form a self-healing wireless mesh network that works off of Bluetooth, Wifi, and cellular. Only a single outlet needs a signal out for all outlets to have a connection. In all of our installs we’ve never had a scenario where we couldn’t get some kind of signal out, but are building a few updates that will allow us to work where there is absolutely zero signal.', 'Yes, that’s the core problem with EverCharge it’s still very expensive and doesn’t exactly solve the core issue which is simply lack of power. It’s a great solution for fleets and new high end apartments but older apartments/condos always have the same problem. \n\nI now work for Orange Charger after EverCharge was acquired by SK E&S, which at least cuts down significantly on costs (~70%) because its lower-powered and thus can use lower gauge wire cutting down on the copper.', 'Thanks for your question.\n\nFirst unlike Chargie, Orange designs, manufactures, and operates all of our products. So we don’t simple make an operating software on a white labeled product. Our Outlets are designed to last 10,000 cycles (ie. Plug/in-plug) which makes them essentially the longest lasting outlet on the market. \n\nSecond, the reason software is a requirement in multi family housing is that electricity isn’t free and needs to be accurately accounted for. As such you’ll need a comercial watt hour meter built-in to monitor, bill, and reimburse the residents/property. This service requires capital on our end to manage and maintain hence monthly fees. As for huge fees, that’s relative but I’d hardly consider max $20/month a “huge fee”.\n\nThird, if a landlord chooses to purchase our product they aren’t “locked in” to our platform. They can use the outlets as simple dumb outlets if they want, however they’ll be unable to get a return on investment that our stations provide. Residents simple want affordable access to charging which we provide. \n\nLastly, If Orange were to go under (which is highly unlikely as the company can easily shift into a maintain model where we simply maintain our existing installs) that’s what OCPP is for. So another party can continue to operate the stations without issue. In the worst case scenario the outlets still work and supply power the access control and data management would simply go away. \n\nHope this further explains our solution.', 'Yes electrical capacity is an issue that eventually boils down to costs. To retrofit with Orange will typically cost $1000-1300. \n\nSmall garages/parking areas don’t matter just yet, they will in the near future, it’s about bringing access to these communities first as here in the Bay Area only 9% of EVs are located at multi family housing. By putting in enough for 10% of each community we enable thousands of new EVs on the road. \n\nGetting to 100% is the main goal but it’s going to take time.', ""In those cases hit up a fast charger.

So your 20$/mo is 20% of that. I would say that a pretty big cut when the tenant supplies the EVSE and the car and the landlord paid for the hardware and installation.  Your company just supplies the server that processes the transaction.  A landlord with 20 users could easily justify the costs of a server for 400/month if it is 20/user for your service.\n\nAlso turning this 350$ device into a 10$ dumb outlet by disconnecting it doesn’t make this a viable option to disconnect from your network.

The landlord can take over management if they so choose if the company were to fail, which again is highly unlikely.\n\nIf this was such an easy solution as you seem to claim there would be far higher market penetration in multi family communities which there’s not. The reality is that multi family charging is incredibly difficult for a multitude of reasons. Property owners have little interest in owning and operating a server let alone managing charging infrastructure on top.

Universal charging networks need all of the billing hardware/software built into each charger, and must have a persistent internet connection to communicate with the billing servers.\n\nTesla's chargers are simplistic in comparison.  They're essentially an electricity spigot that sends whatever energy the car is asking for.  All of the charge tracking and billing is handled by the car's computer.  Tesla can't simply open up their chargers to other brands because the chargers themselves aren't capable of handling the billing.  It would require Tesla software be added to the non-Tesla vehicles, which I highly doubtful OEMs will ever agree to do.\n\nSince the billing is done in the Tesla, the process is seamless.  There doesn't need to be a persistent internet connection.  if there's no connection, the car can simply store the charging data, and can send it to Tesla later after it regains its connection.  Tesla already has the credit card info on file.

Is FREE DC Fast Charging a Problem?,"So, I'm interested in purchasing a used ID.4 or Ioniq 5. However, I need the expertise of this group to clear something up for me.

I know that both vehicles came with a certain amount of FREE DC Fast charging for new purchases/leases. Should I be hesitant to buy a previously owned/leased ID.4 or Ioniq 5 because they have been excessively/needlessly fast charged (instead of L2) just because it was free? Is the battery protection system in these cars good enough that there will still be good battery life left for me as the used buyer?  FYI, I plan to L2 charge it almost exclusively when I purchase.

I guess I could ask it a different way: Would YOU be hesitant to buy a used ID.4 or Ioniq 5 because of excessive FREE DC Fast charging by the previous owner/lessee?

The Problem with Charging,"While EV's are great in some respects there are tons of downfalls that are always left out. Besides the obvious issues of charging time and range the time spent waiting for a charger is always left out. I am certain that this issue is far more prevalent in more populated areas but I'm sure everyone will experience it at some point or another.

Often you will have to wait 10-30 minutes to use a charger. Add that on top of the 30 or so minutes needed to charge you already killed an hour of your day. Sure there will be the times that you roll up and charge but that's less likely in a metropolitan area. It gets better when the vehicle is a rental car and the person is working out how to charge for the very first time while at the charger. It gets better when there is a network error or the charger doesn't accept credit cards or a form digital pay.

Another issue is when people abandon their vehicles. In my experience, this seems to be the case at least 25% of time I have visited various chargers. It happens too often that a vehicle or two will still be hooked up after having a full charge and no sign of the owner.

If it isn't an abandoned then there is a moderate probability that the driver is getting in some quality ZZZ's. They are completely unaware and often not concerned with anyone else around them.

EV drivers are not impervious to terrible parking. Much like every where else you will still run into a very tight fit because someone is on the threshold of the other parking spot. In my experience, this is usually a Mercedes driver. I have actually seen a Chevy that parallel parked in two perpendicular lanes.

Line cutters are real. There are several me monsters that will drive around the line of vehicles waiting their turn to jump ahead and charge. In 25 years of driving I've seen one person jump ahead to get fuel while in 6 months I've seen it happen 4 times when waiting for a charger

You should also expect to see broken chargers. Assume one third of the chargers will be down. You can report it to the company that owns the charger  but they are always slow to make repairs.

The app is often inaccurate but delays in availability should be expected. It's always a great to pull up to the chargers and see a readily available, working charger even though the app says otherwise. The opposite is far more likely.

Charging speed has a few areas to be covered. A charger may state that it is capable of 150/350kw per hour but that doesn't mean much. A damaged charger will still deliver charge at a much lower rate. Electrify America for instance will cap at 38ish when the cable is damaged. Even a fully functional charger may not deliver anywhere near the advertised speed or your vehicles maximum capability. You can precondition the battery all you want but you get what you get.

Another issue with charging is that vehicles charge att different speeds. There are several low end electric vehicle that will only add 20-30% while other more refined vehicles will add 30-80% over the same amount of time. In my area, when there is a sea of Hyundai, Kia, and Chevy's waiting or already on the charger it's not worth waiting.

You may say ""you can charge at home"" but I don't agree with that. If this is going to be the replacement to ICE vehicles it should be just as easily to refill especially since this is being forced upon the masses. You don't have to refuel everyday so why should anyone have to charge daily/nightly.

"My first year with an EV, why I am never going back","Last year, after totaling my gas guzzling Mercedes C300, I decided that I was finally going to give the electric car market a chance. I first bought a used 2020 Ford Fusion, which I quite liked, but I only owned it for a few months before my dad totaled his old POS 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis, which he basically drove into the ground. Now, insurance offered him 4000 bucks for this car, but my state, Colorado, offers 6000 for old gas powered cars IF you are planning on using the money to buy a new EV. So, I made my dad an offer he couldn't refuse, I traded him my 2020 Ford Fusion in exchange for 2002 POS. Then I traded the 2002 POS in for my 6000 and started looking for an EV. 



After shopping around quite a bit, I finally settled on the Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE. I have now owned this car for one year, and it has been a delight! It is by the far the nicest car I have ever owned, it is reliable, the ride is smooth and comfortable, it has a large amount of cargo space for a sedan (especially with the back seats folded down), it has acceleration that is absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD, and it is a visually striking, unique and beautiful car.



Not only that, it is much cheaper to operate than any other car I have ever owned. I get to drive for the first two years for free, because the car comes with two years of free charging at Electrify America charging stations, but even after that, when I am doing most of my charging at home, I have found that it costs me, on average, about 8 dollars to fully charge my car at home. I usually charge about 4 times a month, so that works out to about 32 dollars a month to drive my car, compared to the roughly 270 dollars a month I was spending on gas for my old Mercedes, or 90 dollars a month with my Ford Fusion. It's not a perfect car, the frunk (front trunk) is so small that it's basically useless, the collision detection system is a bit too sensitive, it beeps at you sometimes even if nothing is in front of you, and the Apple Carplay is basically unusable because if you try to play music with it the sound will keep cutting in and out. Fortunately, if you just use bluetooth this isn't a problem, it's only an issue if you connect via USB. 



The knobs and dials on the dashboard are too small and kind of obnoxious to use, but at least the car has buttons, too many electric cars nowadays have no buttons at all, only a touchscreen. From what I have found, the range is actually slightly better than advertised too, I've been able to get 400 miles of range out of a single charge a few times. Usually I get about 360 to 370. I've taken this thing on multiple roadtrips now, including up into the Rocky Mountains and on back country dirt roads, and I haven't run into any problems. I've even taken it camping with me and found that it is quite a convenient camping car. Trips that would normally cost hundreds of dollars in gas are now basically free with the Electrify America free charging! 



I love that the back seats fold down too, I was able to haul a big vintage teak and jade desk that my father gave me by just shoving it in the trunk, putting the back seats down, and then shoving it up against the front seats. None of the other cars I have owned (all sedans) could have possibly fit this desk in their trunks. The storage space in the Ioniq 6 is impressive, and very convenient. In addition, the price is just right. I only paid 26k, after all the tax credits, rebates, and bonus cash, and I bought the car brand new!



I used all the money I got back from the rebates and whatnot to install solar panels on the roof of my house, and to have a level 2 charger installed in my garage. My above calculations about cost were NOT including the solar panels, so in reality my cost per month is probably even lower than 32 bucks. If I charge at night it costs me about 8 dollars, obviously since it is nighttime I can't use my solar panels but I do get cheaper electricity from Xcel Energy. I also get a 50 dollar bill credit every year if I only charge at night. If, on the other hand, I charge during the day roughly 50% of the electricity would be coming from my solar panels and then 50% would be coming from the grid. However, because of the way Xcel Energy's electricity pricing works, electricity is more expensive during the daytime, it works out to about...6ish dollars per charge. 



My wife, who comes from a country that doesn't really have EVs yet, is absolutely blown away by this car, she thinks it's a futuristic super car! 



That brings me to my next point about this car, and that is the reception I get while driving it. I've been made fun of for pointing this out on Reddit before, but this car really is a status symbol. When I brought it home my neighbors all came out to gawk at it, and my next door neighbor told me that it was ""too nice for the neighborhood, you better put it in the garage"". Lots of people have complimented me on it, and expressed total shock when I tell them what I paid for it (26k). 



Heck, my own family, including my own wife and her family, were in complete shock that I was able to afford this thing, because it does not look like a cheap car. I remember last Thanksgiving everybody had to come out and take a look at it and take a ride in it. Now they all think that I'm doing quite well for myself, better than I'm letting on, and one of my cousins decided he was going to one up me by buying a Cybertruck. A bunch of my relatives are buying EVs now because they feel like they're being left behind. Many of my friends now think I'm rich because of this car, and they're incredibly jealous. One of my friends even said ""Man, I need to get my life together so I can buy one of these!"" when he rode in it for the first time. 



Truth is though, I bought this car not because it is cool (even though it is), but because it would save me money. I was trying to be frugal and lower my monthly expenses as much as humanly possible, and the Ioniq 6 was one of only two EVs that met all my requirements. 



So, after one full year with an EV, I am NEVER going back to ICE cars. The monthly expenses for ICE vehicles are far too much for me to ever consider going back, especially with how much gas prices have risen. My wife is currently getting her learner's permit, she has never driven before, and we are on the hunt for a good electric starter car for her. I'm thinking of getting her a 2021 Hyundai Ioniq 1 Electric. One issue I have noticed in the EV industry is the lack of good starter cars. There are a few, but not as many as I was hoping for.

Our experience owning an EV and losing power for 7 days,"Our family endured 7 days without electricity due to the 2024 summer storm in Northern Ohio.

Lots of people ask EV owners ""What will you do when the power is out?"" and I want to share our experience.

I don't top my car off every single day.  I charge the car at home every two weeks when it hits 20%.   When the power went out, the EV was at 40% charge.   This is roughly 100 miles of range and was more than enough to cover for a few days.  This storm occurred suddenly, and only lasted about 20 minutes but did unthinkable damage here in the suburbs.  I personally have never seen something like this where we live.   4 or 5 confirmed touch downs for tornados.  This is not a hurricane where people are warned over and over again for days until it lands.  There was no real preparation for this.

We have a 4kw gas generator.  It's an older Generac 4000xl.  We have an all electric home so there is no natural gas.

We needed gas for the generator, but the gas stations didn't have power.  Ironically, nobody is getting any gas.  Once the gas stations had power, residents cleaned them out.   The lines for the gas station were so long, police had to direct traffic.   People were panic buying and causing a domino effect.   The three gas stations closest to us were now out of gas.

We had to drive to another city to fill our gas cans.  

On the third day of our ordeal, the EV was down to 25%.   I was running our fridge, our freezer, three aquariums, the TV and the neighbors fridge off of our generator.  We're still not anywhere near 4K watts yet.   We have a 20 amp 4 prong cable that plugs into the generator.  I stopped at home depot and bought a 14-50 plate with a box and fashioned a plug for the EV charger at the end of the generator's 30a cable.

On the Polestar 2's charging interface, you can limit the amps it draws from the charger.  I started with just 5 amps and slowly increased it one at a time until I heard the generator struggle and then backed off.   With everything else I was running, I was able to dedicate 2.8kw of power to the EV.   I let that sit over night and had 65% charge in the morning.   It's slow, but completely viable.  As long as we can power the generator, all of this is a working solution.  There's a joke in there somewhere about burning fossil fuels to charge the EV (for one day, lol)  but I don't let that rhetoric bug me.

We do own a CX5 and worst come to worst, we can drive that.   I didn't want to use the gas in that car since gas was getting pretty scarce to begin with.  I tried to use the EV as much as possible instead.   It's just an option if we had to.  

Now we had a new problem.  Our local grocery stores had no power and all perishables.... perished.    Some stores remained open on a cash basis, but only offered non-perishables.  The panic buyers cleaned out anything of real value.   Bottled water and sports drinks were completely gone as well.   Fortunately, I keep a lot of canned food and we have food stock in a deep freezer.  We're not afraid of tap water either.

On the 5th day we still didn't have power, but many areas of town did.  I stopped by a Sheetz and their level 3 chargers were online.   In 25 minutes, I topped the car off to 90%.   Good for another two weeks.

That week was hard.   Debris, trees, power lines, and telephone poles blocking the streets. Gas stations without power.  Gas stations without gas.  People competing for resources, hoarding, and panic buying.   Empty grocery stores.   We had to cook like we were camping every day.

The one thing that was never really a problem was the EV.

I know that is circumstantial.  We have a generator.  The EV had a decent charge when this happened.   We had a resource that most our neighbors didn't.  However, if Sheetz doesn't have power to charge the EV, they don't have power to pump gas either.   If we can't get gas to power the generator, we can't gas a car either.   Once they had power, gas everywhere was gone in two days, while the chargers still stood.   It's also fair to point out that if I didn't have a generator, I still don't think the EV would have hit zero before Sheetz had power again. 

There is a scenario where none of this is possible.   Many people don't own a generator.   If the power went down, in the entire state, and gas everywhere was gone, you would have a hard time charging an EV.  You would probably have a hard time gassing the car, too.  This wasn't the collapse of the United States or the zombie apocalypse though.  This was a common scenario where a bad storm knocked out power for a week.   If someone lived in an apartment, relied strictly on public charging networks, and left their car at 5% charge they would probably be screwed.

My own personal take away is that I should top the car off more at home.  If a storm is on the horizon, I should prepare a little better. 

My advice to anyone potentially shopping is as such

* Don't do it if you can't charge at home.  It's ridiculously convenient and it costs us $3.80 to charge from 20% to 90%.   If you're willing to deal with 100% public charging then you are braver than I am.   Here electrify America Charger charge us $0.56kwh while our rate at home is $.065kwh.   It costs a little more than $30 to charge our car using their superchargers - about the same as gas
* Depending on the car, you may not need some $600 charging station and $2000 to have it installed at home.    I ran the outlet myself and it was probably $150 in parts only because HD charges too much for small runs of wire.  Find out for what a particular car needs before buying anything.  If you need to upgrade your whole panel that will likely cost a lot of money.  That particular project cost me $1600 for 200a service and 30 breakers.  The service itself was already 200a and did not need upgraded.
* I just told you that the upgrade cost $1600.  I originally didn't do it because the internet told me that would cost anywhere from $4K to $6K.   Don't believe the internet - get quotes yourself.  My electrician was also smart enough to know that if the charging unit has GFCI then its bad to put it on a GFCI breaker and installed it the way the manufacture said instead of arguing semantics about code.
* If you can charge at home, *and* you have a garage or shed to store a small generator, that is a good investment even if your generator sits for 2 years before using it.  It isn't just about the car, but not losing $300 of food in the fridge and $300 in the freezer, and not being hosed because the grocery store ran dry as well.
* If you live in a city like mine with just *one* supercharger, its a good idea to back it up with a gas car.   I am just being practical.

I wrote this a while ago, and there's been a development since.  I learned how to power the entire house with the generator by running a 50 amp cable from the generator to the house's EV plug.  That's right.  I turn off the service shutoff breaker and feed electricity back to the panel via the 50 amp plug in the garage.   I turn off breakers it doesn't have the juice to run like the AC and the range.  I can still trickle charge the EV using the 20a plug exactly the way I was doing it before.   Someday I will upgrade the generator as I would like AC as well.   I read that you're not supposed to do this without an expensive switching system or at least a simple breaker lock that doesn't allow both to be on at the same time.  Safety first of course.

I have also had people suggest that I buy an inverter and I can run the fridge and freezers off of the car itself.  I looked into that.  Unfortunately it looks like the Polestar 2 isn't readily capable of that, as it only charges it's 12v battery while its moving.",604,"['This experience is a good reason for always be charging, especially during storm seasons.', 'I didn’t have an EV during hurricane Sandy, but 19 days with no grid power I did learn that gasoline powered vehicles were basically useless in a grid down situation. \n\nWhatever stations still had gasoline and power to pump it were inundated with people buying it for generators (we were using ~7 gallons a day for ours, 125 gallons in total), at which point the stations tanks would be drained in a matter of hours. \n\nDiesel I could still get no problem.

Right now, the infrastructure for V2H in my country isn’t quite there yet (well you have to piece it together at your own price, which might not be worth the cost), so we will probably do a home battery for now.

Sure, not great - but at least it's just yourself and your own house.\n\nIf you make a mistake backfeeding your house through a generator like this, you risk the same to your own house, *and also backfeed the entire power distribution line at super-high voltage*.  This kills the people working to repair the power lines, because they expect the power lines to be powered down.\n\nThe power transformer leading to your house is normally configured to convert ~10,000 volts from the distribution line (instant death) into 240V for your house.

From 40% to 25% would mean you used about 37.5 miles of range in 3 days.  Or maybe you meant you woke up on the third day at 25%... which would still mean you only used 37.5 miles over 2 days, or 18.75 miles per day.  The average driver in the US has a roundtrip commute that's over 32 miles.\n\nYour points about going to a charger in another town doesn't exactly apply at a high adoption rate for BEVs.  What's the adoption rate in Ohio... about 1% or less?  What happens if that increases to 50%?  75%?  100%?  Remember that DC fast charging infrastructure is primarily setup for people to make longer trips, and maybe some consideration for people living in apartments without access to nightly charging.  It is not built up to handle every car in a region charging in a period of 1-2 weeks.  The network won't be robust enough to handle every car in a region needing to charge.  If you want to talk about lines at gas stations, imagine the lines at fast chargers with high BEV adoption rates.  The cars aren't spending 5 minutes apiece to fill up, they're spending 30+ minutes.\n\nThat said, not every BEV will need to charge since they don't all allow the charge to run down so much.\n\nYou mentioned the lines when the gas stations got their power back.  It's possible for gas stations to run their pumps using generators... so did they get their power back from the utility, or because they hooked up some generators?  Some states are now mandating gas stations have backup generators.\n\nAs to charging from a gas generator... the irony is that some small gasoline generators don't have catalytic converters, and thus emit toxic emissions along with CO2.  They're also often extremely loud.  Can you imagine if every house in your neighborhood were running these generators during a regional power outage to charge their cars?  \n\nGiven how little you drive, it seems to me that there's no large benefit to owning a BEV.  In terms of triaging the largest gas users out of their ICEs and into BEVs, you'd be pretty low on the list.  Frankly, your daily range is so low that having a large battery BEV is just kind of wasteful, and I imagine age degradation will be more impactful than degradation from cycling it.  What if that battery were instead split into multiple smaller packs for use in multiple PHEVs that each uses a higher percentage of their total capacity on the daily to replace gas miles?  I imagine it would reduce significantly more gas use across all the cars that got some of those cells.\n\nThe reality is, the BEV community and owners don't really care enough about the environment to really consider min/maxing solutions; aka the most effective and efficient solutions to mitigating emissions.  They often get their high powered over battery'd BEVs and insist it's a magic bullet that's solved their emissions footprint and they don't have to do much if anything else.  People who own solar panels will often suggest it's about the environment, but the reality is it's mostly about the cost savings.  This is why they tend to pitch such a bitch when net metering payments are lowered or revoked.\n\nGiven your daily driving range, it sounds like a PHEV would have been perfect for you.  In fact, if PHEVs were built with an inverter to export power, you could not only get by using your car's battery to power your house, but also use gas in your car as a generator (with a catalytic converter) .  Some Chevy Volt owners have rigged up inverters in their cars to use as a backup power source.  Imagine if it came like that from the factory.\n\nIf your home just happened to be in an area with let's say power outages that come a few times a year, having backup power would be as simple as keeping a 5 gallon gas can with some STA-BIL in it in your garage.\n\nThe Ford F-150 pro-power hybrid can export power in the event of a power outage.  All it necessitates is an extension cord going to your appliances, or a transfer switch to connect the 220V outlet to.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again... a nationwide transition to PHEVs prior to transitioning to BEVs would have been the better route for reducing auto related emissions.  Their operational costs are nearly in line with BEVs.  Their emissions reduction can be fairly close to BEVs.  They use less critical materials and more vehicles could have been rapidly produced given battery cell production shortages.  Their flexibility is unmatched.  It would require zero new DC charging infrastructure to enable them to travel long distances, they can use gas while often seeing better fuel economy than comparable ICEVs.\n\nThe negatives is they often don't have the sporty performance of BEVs (not critical), and they have slightly more maintenance costs associated with them.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: No cars are sustainable.  Talking about which car technology is best for the environment is a bit silly since none are truly sustainable or net-zero.  If we really want to minimize emissions quickly, then rapidly transitioning every body who's physically capable to mass public transit and micro-mobility is by far the best solution.  We can also get more people working from home and push for a nationwide 4 day work week to cut down on commuting miles.\n\nFurther, we absolutely should work on producing non-flammable batteries for use in portable PEVs so that they can be safely carried onto public transit and safely stored in homes, apartments, and brought into businesses and offices.\n\nCombining portable PEVs or bikes with public transit improves the efficiency and speed of public transit."", 'The stupidity of EVs is enormous.

Solved the roadtrip charging problem,"I have solved the road trip charger problem! Turns out if we want to drive faster, we need more power Scotty. The P indicates the break even charging power assuming no losses or other effects which affects the result. Spherical cow in a frictionless vacuum and all that jazz. 


P = Vf * Vs (E/Rf - E/Rs)/(Vf -Vs)


So. Vf is the fast speed you are comparing, Vs the slow speed. Rf, the range at the fast speed, Rs at slow speed. E is the energy you have available. E/R is just the efficiency (kwh/mi or kwh/km) of your vehicle at a certain speed which you could put in instead of full battery and range if you know it at both speeds you want to compare. Stay consistent and this baby will tell you what the minimum charging speed is needed to make the fast speed plus charging time less than or equal to the slow speed plus charging time. Both are assumed to be dead flat at the start which makes this the lower bound charging speed and kneecaps the slow speed. 

Example Sedan using 68˚F data from geotab blog about ""ev-range-impact-of-speed-and-temperature""

Vf = 90mph

Vs = 89mph

E = 65kwh

Rf = 184mi

Rs = 188mi

P = 89mph * 90mph (65kwh/184mI - 65kwh/188mi)/(90mph-89mph)

P = 60.2kw

So you need at least 60kw chargers for the faster speed of 90mph be less time on a road trip than at 89mph. So since most all DCFC are above 50kw this seems to be a non issue, as long as they are open and available.",0,"['Thanks for doing the formula and calculations.

Sold my Model Y after a year and here is my advice to new buyers,"I want to start by saying that I believe in electric vehicles (EVs). Despite my negative experience with the Model Y Performance, I still consider EVs to be the future and suitable for many situations. My next vehicle will likely be an EV as well.

I purchased my Model Y P early in 2023, following the initial price reductions. I had been considering an SUV for a while but was also waiting for the post-COVID market to stabilize. At that time, Tesla was suggesting that the tax credit might end in April, which significantly influenced my decision to purchase when I did.

*I would like to begin with the positives:*

1. The car is not bad; it's neither good nor bad, but rather an average car.
2. It is a practical car with ample cargo capacity.
3. The car is quite fast, capable of out-accelerating many other vehicles on the road(Although after 65 it tapers down).
4. Both the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are very responsive.
5. Similar to other electric vehicles, it may be advantageous over internal combustion engine cars depending on your charging setup.
6. The car's software is excellent, possibly the best in its class, with a well-designed and responsive interface.
7. The charging network is great.

*Unfortunately there are a lot of* ***negatives*** *that eventually led me to get rid of the vehicle.*

1. The build quality and quality control of the vehicle were terrible, despite it being a 2023 model which should have been a significant improvement over previous models. Upon taking delivery, I noticed numerous issues: misaligned panels, unpainted areas, and damaged paintwork. The interior had stains, the roof trim was improperly fitted with some parts detached, and the seats didn't fold correctly, among other problems. It required nearly ten service appointments to address the interior and some paint issues, yet many problems remained unresolved. It's worth noting that my experience isn't unique; there was consistently a queue at the service department, mostly with brand new Model Y vehicles.
2. The ride quality is harsh, despite supposedly being the upgraded, softer suspension(mine is the performance so it is stiffer than the regular suspension but still). It's not intolerable on the road, yet it's far from comfortable. Indeed, it's the stiffer performance suspension, and while I'm accustomed to the firmness of sport-tuned suspensions, this one is notably harsh. The suspension struggles to absorb the smaller, high-frequency bumps, and due to the elevated seating position, there's a noticeable amount of lateral vibration. Competing vehicles like Mach-e gt (magneride) were far better than that.
3. The interior quality is subpar, not even matching that of a $25K Corolla. Cars over $30K from brands like Toyota and Subaru feel better in comparison, while a $40K Mazda interior looks like a Maybach next to this vehicle. It's not the minimalist design I appreciate, but rather the fit, finish, and trim quality that are lacking. Although my Model Y Performance was an improvement over the earlier Model 3s I've driven, which were terrible, it still fell short. it is susceptible to developing rattles.
4. This vehicle performs poorly on anything other than asphalt. When I tried it on a flat unpaved gravel road, it was an awful experience. It was virtually impossible to exceed 5mph without experiencing excessive shaking, while regular sedans were able to go faster with much less discomfort.
5. Although the car lacks a bumper camera, it features unnecessarily large rims that limit tire options and are susceptible to curb rash if not handled carefully.
6. Depreciation and price reductions: This car experiences rapid depreciation. While a car is not an investment, few people drive their vehicles until they are no longer usable, making resale value a crucial component of the ownership equation. The problem is Tesla dynamically ""marks up"" their vehicles and screws their customers up so much. For instance, even if you purchased this vehicle after the initial price reductions last year for the high 50's, the base price has now dropped to nearly 50, and every few months, one might receive an additional $5k+ on an inventory vehicle. A loss of over $20K in the first year is substantial. It's sad to consider those who paid in the high 60s without any tax credit. With the added expenses of higher registration and insurance costs, it quickly surpasses any savings from electricity and other operating costs.
7. Although the straight-line performance is impressive, this vehicle is not designed for sports; its handling is average—neither good nor bad, just acceptable. Driving a Model 3 on a winding road can be somewhat enjoyable, but model y does not quite match up.
8. The range isn't poor, yet it's significantly less than the advertised figure, varying with use. Initially, it was claimed to offer a 303-mile range, but Tesla later adjusted this to 285 miles. Practically, the range is between 200-250 miles, unless one is driving at 35 mph in the city under warm conditions.
9. Many features seem underdeveloped. They eliminated ultrasonic sensors to save $100, yet promised vision-based parking. After a year, they released a version that's somewhat functional. However, it still has a significant blind spot in the front, lacks a complete 360-degree view, and it's often unavailable or inaccurate.
10. The service center experience was not good. Several times they didn't properly address the issue and other times introduced new problems while fixing some.  It felt like they were overworked.

# Now my advice for new buyers :

**Should you buy a Model Y now?** Honestly, NO. This car isn't worth the current base price; it's cheaply built. Additionally, it's an outdated design likely in its final production year. The new Model 3 seems to address some of the major issues, so the upcoming model Y might be a better option.

**Remember that you don't know exactly what you will get.** For instance, Tesla transitioned to hairpin motors in late 2022. The hairpin performance motor is designated as 4D1, while the older wire-wound motors are referred to as 3DX/980/990. Some buyers of the performance model still received the older 980 motor, whereas some regular Long Range buyers received the 4D1. It has been observed that even this year, some Performance models were equipped with the older, slightly less efficient 980/3D1 motor, while individuals who paid less for a Long Range received the 4D1. Although I was fortunate in the motor lottery, this practice is unacceptable. The switch from hardware 3 to 4 was made abruptly, and by sheer chance, some customers received the newer version while others did not. This randomness when spending such an amount is frustrating.

***If you want to buy***, Consider opting for a used, low-mileage 2022 or newer model. Starting with a $15,000 saving off the base price or more. Alternatively, if you prefer a new vehicle, wait for regular inventory discounts and combine them with the tax credit to minimize depreciation effects. If you're ineligible for the tax credit, again consider a used, low-mileage option.

Avoid rushing into a loan. Patience is key in the long term. I know people who intended to purchase a Model X and were exploring financing options for the remaining $20K. They ultimately refrained, and the vehicle's price subsequently dropped significantly more than that amount. They avoided a financial misstep. Taking on financing to cover what may essentially be a substantial Tesla markup would have sucked. Tesla's marketing can be misleading regarding prices, so trust only your research and historical data.

***Should I buy a new MY to save on fuel costs?***   For most people, this doesn't make sense. If you drive nearly 20,000 miles a year and plan to keep the vehicle for over six years, it might make sense. Otherwise, the depreciation, registration, and insurance costs can negate the savings on fuel and operating expenses. However, purchasing a used one with a significant amount of warranty remaining could be a viable alternative.

**If I live in an apartment?** Living in an apartment can be manageable if you have access to a supercharger nearby or the ability to charge at work. However, if the cost of electricity is high, you might end up charging at a supercharger late at night to benefit from a lower rate.

**Leasing ev's from other manufacturers seems like an interesting option.**

There are some attractive leasing options available from various manufacturers. These not only offer significant price reductions but also eliminate the obligation to purchase at the end of the lease if the depreciation is substantial. I have tested the Mach-e GT, Ioniq 5, and Volvo C40, and found that all these vehicles surpass the Model Y in terms of build quality and ride comfort. You have choices; take the time to test drive these vehicles and conduct your own research.

Hope this helps to new buyers,

Good luck

Possibly a slight advantage on batteries on account of natural advantages from the smaller cylindrical cell form factor's ability to get better contact coverage with cooling ribbons, and ability to spread charge/discharge loads between a larger surface area bus bar with more contact points with individual cells.\n\nOtherwise, Tesla's main advantages are cutting weight and prioritizing drag coefficient and minimizing front surface area to improve overall aero.  You really only need to stand behind a Tesla to see how they cut front surface area.  Above the belt line, the top of the car aggressively tapers in, reducing overall front surface area.  While great for aero, it's likely partly why the interiors have a weird echo; passengers' heads are closer to the side glass?\n\nLower weight allows Teslas to accelerate faster with lower horsepower, and given they're not fighting as hard against air resistance, it takes less energy to maintain high acceleration at higher speeds, so the system is easier to cool overall.  The less air resistance and the lower the weight, the less energy used to accelerate, allowing the battery and motors to stay cooler, which allows the front active vents to stay closed for longer, further improving aerodynamics.\n\nMuch of the reduced weight comes from their increased use of aluminum in their chassis, body panels, and suspension.  (Ever notice how light a model 3 door feels?) They have minimal noise insulation, and by removing buttons, they've decreased the weight of the wiring harnesses.  The interior panels are cheap and flimsy.  The depth of the seats is actually quite narrow compared to a lot of other cars; yet gotta give it to them that most people seem to think they're pretty comfortable.  No doubt they've also saved weights by building purpose built EV powertrain equipment from scratch, whereas established OEMs were attempting to use existing equipment from parts suppliers that wasn't specifically targeted to the task at hand.\n\nMost established OEMs concentrate efforts on NVH, they do use more steel in their vehicles, they do use more buttons, they are building cars on existing ICEV platforms / models where aero wasn't as critical (because engines actually needed the front surface area for cooling).  Other brands don't only have 1-2 models (basically the same vehicle with different sheet metal) where they can streamline every little detail for those nearly identical models.  Established brands may have dozen or more models and multiple platforms where some of the parts being supplied need to work with multiple models/platforms so can't be perfectly streamlined for individual models.\n\nOf course, with all that weight savings aluminum... if you so much as look at a Tesla the wrong way, it could be totaled."", ""Yes, they are.

I am thinking of replacing my electric car with a petrol car and have some questions.,"1. I have heard that petrol cars can not refuel at home while you sleep? How often do you have to refill elsewhere? Is this several times a year? Will there be a solution for refueling at home?

2. Which parts will I need service on and how often? The car salesman mentioned a box with gears in it. What is this and will I receive a warning with an indicator when I need to change gear? 

3. Can I accelerate and brake with one pedal as I do today with my electric car?

4. Do I get fuel back when I slow down or drive downhill? I assume so, but need to ask to be sure. 

5. The car I test drove seemed to have a delay from the time I pressed the accelerator pedal until it began to accelerate. Is that normal in petrol cars?

6. We currently pay about 1.2p per mile to drive our electric car. I have heard that petrol can cost up to 10 times as much so I reckon we will lose some money in the beginning. We drive about 20,000 miles a year. Let's hope more people will start using petrol so prices go down.

7. Is it true that petrol is flammable? Should I empty the tank and store the petrol somewhere else while the car is in the garage? 

8. Is there an automatic system to prevent gasoline from catching fire or exploding in an accident. What does this cost?

9. I understand that the main ingredient in petrol is oil. Is it true that the extraction and refining of oil causes environmental problems as well as conflicts and major wars that over the last 100 years have cost millions of lives? Is there a solution to these problems?

10..I have heard that cars with internal combustion based engines are being banned to enter more and more cities around the world, as it is claimed that they tend to harm the environment and health of their citizens?? Is that true??

I may have more questions later, but these are the most important ones to me at the moment.

Engines need less than £100 spending annually, and it can easily be done by all but the most hamfisted home mechanic. Engine and boxes of gears never go wrong really (in the grand scheme of things) - it\'s always suspension, brakes, electrics or body-rot. \n3.\tYes. The right pedal will provide acceleration and retardation. Using the box of gears you could slow down quite quickly without using the brakes. Brakes remain standard for emergency use or if you haven\'t planned ahead sufficiently. \n4.\tNo in most cars (some mild hybrids and beyond do), but fuel supply is cut off on a trailing throttle so you aren\'t using fuel either. \n5.\tNo that isn\'t normal. Throttle response should be imperceptible, even with a turbocharger and automatic gearbox. There is some delay with most automatic boxes of gears on initial getaway (to do with torque converters), but it\'s minor and after 30 minutes you won\'t notice it. \n6.\tCost per mile of fuel is mostly tax. Currently electricity isn\'t taxed for motoring (but it will be, so expect cost per mile to increase). Usually offset by cheaper initial purchase price. \n7.\tNot really.

You may need to purchase additional accessories in order to refuel at home (i.e. A still)\n2. The petrol engine requires fairly frequent servicing relative to an electric vehicle.  Most other components will require similar servicing intervals to your previous vehicle, although brakes may need a somewhat more frequent interval.  Most gearboxes change gears by themselves.  If changing gears is a concern, look for an ""Automatic"" transmission.\n3. Somewhat, but not well enough to rely on.\n4. If you drive a petrol car like the first one I owned, the gas gauge clearly shows you gain fuel when braking and turning left, but lose fuel when accelerating or turning right.\n5. You may have been driving a old, or lower quality model.  High end modern cars have a nearly imperceptible delay when pressing the accelerator.\n6. The higher price for petrol is the cost of the lower upfront cost.  It\'s expensive to be poor.\n7. Petrol is flammable, but don\'t worry! As long as it\'s safely contained in the gas tank of the car, the chance of it igniting is extremely low.  If it does start on fire, it\'s relatively easy to put out with a simple fire extinguisher.  The lubricating oil in the engine is much more likely to ignite than the petrol, since it\'s kept much closer to very hot components.\n8. Sadly, whenever you store a bunch of energy in one place, there\'s always a chance of fire.  Don\'t believe the movies, the gasoline doesn\'t explode at the slightest jostling! There are automatic systems, but they\'re not cost effective for consumer vehicles at this time.\n9. Yes, they have caused these issues.

I don't see a question there, but unfortunately the price of petrol has so much tax on it there's almost no chance of decrease. \n\n7. Yes, petrol is technically flammable. But I wouldn't call it flammable a bad thing. It doesn't spontaneously combust when exposed to air like batteries might. It takes a lot of air plus a spark to ignite it, plus it doesn't burn long. No need to remove it for storage. \n\n8. An automatic system to prevent the gasoline from exploding in a fire is designed into all gas tanks sold in the us and eu. No additional cost. \n\n9. Extracting oil has plenty of drawbacks as you seem to have learned. The solution most of us are leaning towards is burning something else. Food oil is an option, as is methane and hydrogen. This is a far away solution though. \n\n10. That's probably true, a lot of cities have substantial problems that are leading them to ban petrol vehicles. As far as petrol cars harming the environment, that's kinda complicated. A leaky petrol car can harm the environment due to having more fluids then an electric car, but petrol cars are easier on tires and roads too so it's hard to say which is truly better.

Put simply: input electricity and you output motion, but input motion and you output electricity. So when you tap the brake pedal in an EV that has regen, the car's computer will instruct the motor to stop powering the wheels and instead capture the wheel motion and produce energy to charge the battery. This absorbs the momentum energy from the wheels and thus acts as a brake. Note that in low speed situations the car can rely mostly on regen to slow down, but inevitably it will apply the actual physical brakes to compensate for higher speed situations or emergency braking situations, so you still get some brake wear over time, but it's a hell of a lot less than in an ICEV that relies solely on those physical brakes.\n\nRegarding drivetrain maintenance on an EV: it is also dramatically reduced compared to an ICEV, because an electric motor is an incredibly reliable device, with literally only one moving part, which requires very little maintenance compared to an ICEV. Almost all EVs also don't require a multi-gear transmission because they produce enough torque to get by with only one gear, so this removes the transmission maintenance element from the equation as well. And the ICEV cooling system, fueling system, exhaust system, intake system, and everything else that goes along with an ICE that requires maintenance or repair make them far more complicated and expensive to maintain and less reliable.\n\nIn terms of the computer systems, both ICEV and EV in modern cars use very sophisticated computers and there isn't much difference there other than the software, so it isn't like an EV has a higher computer maintenance requirement.

Road trips seem a lot less stressful in ICE vs my EV6,"Before I get buried in downvotes and accusations of being an EV hater, I just want to say that I do really love my Kia EV6 for local driving.  The ride quality is great and the handling characteristics of EVs make it extremely enjoyable to drive around compared to ICE vehicles.  I also am very happy with it for relatively short road trips where I can charge at my destination and where I'll only need to stop once on the way, since planning alternative charging stops in that scenario is not too difficult.  This is my US-specific opinion based on living and travelling in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic US, so things may be better or worse in other countries or areas.

That said, I just did a 1300 mile (roundtrip) road trip and I have to say I'm glad that I chose to take my ICE vehicle (Subaru Legacy) instead of my EV6.  In retrospect, the trip would have been so much more stressful in my EV6 especially with the tight schedule I had.  There are three main things that I think would have made my EV6 a more stressful choice:

**1) Lack of reliable 175kW+ charger availability.**

Relative to most other EVs, the EV6 and other eGMP vehicles are capable of faster charging, and this was a huge part of the reason I got this car.  However, only a fraction of deployed DCFC stalls can actually take full advantage of this.  My EV6 can hold 230kW+ speeds for a huge chunk of the charging curve.  After perusing PlugShare, I discovered that the only places on my route that consistently had any 175kW+ chargers were the Electrify America, Pilot/Flying J, Circle K, and (weirdly) Ford dealerships.  Most of the other ""fast"" chargers were 125kW or below, often 62.5kW or 50kW.  When I'm doing a long drive in one day, I really don't like stopping for longer than it takes me to use the bathroom and grab a snack - 10-15 minutes at most.  I don't want to be stuck at a slow ""fast"" charger for longer than I need to be.  Virtually every gas station offers both 87 and 91-93 Octane gas, so I believe that every DCFC should offer at least one actually fast charger.

This won't be fixed by the Tesla network opening either, because superchargers can't do 800V which means they provide comparatively slow charging speeds to 800V eGMP vehicles.  V4 superchargers capable of 800V+ are currently vaporware since zero of them have been deployed as of today.  Having to spot-check the PlugShare reviews for each DCFC site before stopping there to avoid ending up at a ""dud"" is also pretty annoying.  I've experienced having a gas pump fail to work correctly a total of two times in my entire life.  In the 5 months I've had the EV6, I've had a charging failure due to a dispenser issue happen over a dozen times at various DCFC stations.  I realize it's a lot more complicated, but they (DCFC site and network operators) will need to do a much better job with reliability if they want people to switch to EVs.

**2) Excessive number of stops.**

At the 75-80mph speeds and 55-65F temperature that nearly all of my travel took place at, my EV6 manages 3mi/kWh (and that's if I'm being optimistic).  Since charging above 80% is slow and dropping below 10% is risky given the sparse infrastructure, only about 70% of my battery capacity is usable on a road trip (compared to 90%+ of the average gas tank).  That's roughly 160mi of usable range between stops, compared to 500+ in my Subaru.  I would have had to stop every 2 hours (likely even more frequently depending how distant the next charger was).  Additionally, many of the possible EV charging stops along my route (EA and dealerships in particular) were not really located somewhere desirable where there's easy access to bathrooms and snacks.  I understand some people might like to stop and stretch every 1.5 to 2 hours, but that's not me.  I want the drive to be over with as fast as possible and stopping makes it take longer.

**3) High DCFC prices relative to gasoline.** 

The Subaru cost between 8.8-9.7 cents per mile to drive on the highway (gas prices ranging $2.90-$3.20/gal at 33mpg), while the EV6 would have cost between 15.0-22.7 cents per mile due to the hugely variable yet consistently expensive cost of DCFC ($0.45-$0.68/kWh after sales tax at 3mi/kWh).  Even if I fully charged at home before leaving, this trip in my EV6 would have cost me almost double the cost of gas.  Gas prices were a lot less variable and did not have sales tax on top of them.  Additionally, it's way easier to compare gas prices as I don't need to go into a bunch of different apps to find the prices, I can just use one app for that.  If I want to know the price of an EA charger, I have to open the EA app.  If I want to know the price of an EVgo charger, I have to open the EVgo app.  This is a crappy experience.

At my destination there were limited options for hotels with L2 chargers.  The single hotel that did have EV charging costed $30 more per night which negated nearly all of the potential DCFC savings.  I booked that one anyway since at the time I wasn't decided on whether I was going to take the EV6 or not.  That hotel had 2 EV chargers - 1 Clipper Creek and 1 Tesla.  The Clipper Creek had a fault light on (which I expected after reading the PlugShare reviews), and the Tesla charger was in use the whole time so I wouldn't have been able to charge anyway.

**Final notes**

I do realize a lot of these issues are not as bad or may not even exist if you drive a Tesla.  I have seen that the Tesla nav does a great job minimizing unnecessary stops.  Tesla seems to also haves better efficiency and range than many comparable EVs so you can go farther between stops.  And finally, Supercharger charging cost for Tesla drivers are generally a lot more reasonable than DCFC costs for non-Tesla owners.  In my city it's 33 cents vs 56 cents.  Huge difference.  Only thing I don't like about the Teslas is the comparatively long 10-80% charging time vs my EV6.

Problem 1 will hopefully be solved if/when more gas station chains get into EV charging, so long as they don't put in ""slow"" fast chargers.  Problem 2 is solved with EVs that have larger/denser batteries and better efficiency (there are already substantially longer-range EVs that charge very quickly available on the market today, they are just prohibitively expensive for me).  Problem 3 I don't see being solved any time soon unless the government mandates open API access for live charging station data or something so that someone can make a single app to easily compare cost, which would help force stations to be more competitive with their pricing.

**TL;DR:**  America's DCFC infrastructure is still very sparse, unreliable, and expensive compared to gasoline.  Only a fraction of DCFC sites offer the high charging speeds supported by eGMP and many other 800V EVs.  Usable EV ""road trip"" range can be <60% of the advertised range due to lower efficiency at highway traffic speeds and due to only being able to effectively use the battery capacity that exists between 10% and 80%.",280,"['I remember the days when we had to go  to AAA so they could highlight a map that would include gas stations and lodging for our family road trips with a vehicle that got about 9 MPG.

With Bluecruise the miles just float on by. \n\nThe killer for me is towing a trailer. It can be as bad as 100 miles. Then you may have to unhitch the trailer as well. I can see why GM went with the battery size they did. \n\nUnfortunately, all in all, we’re still in the Wild West of charging.

The difference isn't really that big now and this is the worst that EVs will ever be.\n\nEven the model 3 LR RWD is pretty good already, and cars like the new taycan really demonstrate what is possible.\n\nIn another 5 years, I doubt you'd want to take the gas car for a trip like this."", ""I don't think it's a controversial take to say that road trips are typically more stressful in an EV than an ICE vehicle.\n\nIt's less convenient and it might cost comparably to an ICE vehicle or worse. And in some cases, it may not even be feasible.\n\nI did a road trip last weekend. It was Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. Finding a charger on the way back was tricky.

That was made worse by my hotel charger beig out of order, requiring a search and slow DC charger the next morning.

It wasn’t stressful since I like taking breaks, and the charging infrastructure was pretty decent overall.

We're now a dual EV household; one 2023 Nissan Ariya Venture+ FWD w/ 304 miles of EPA rated range and one 2024 Subaru Solterra Premium AWD w/ 227 miles of EPA rated range. Both are more than sufficient for our work commutes and I commute 75 miles per day. \n\nWe've already taken both on several road-trips successfully without much stress - but the caveat to that is that both road-trips have been in near-ideal temperatures and weather conditions. We're about to enter our first winter with both and I'm curious to see how both will do. One of the trips we take regularly (Pretty much on a monthly basis) is 420 miles round-trip and we've just recently begun to run into issues w/ having to wait at charging stations due to the lack of CCS chargers available. One place we tend to stop has 5 CCS fast chargers, but 24 Tesla Superchargers - all V3's and neither of our vehicles have support with an adapter yet; the Ariya's support is supposedly around the corner. \n\nIt's generally been pretty hassle free BUT - on the last trip my girlfriend took in her Solterra, she had somebody knocking on her window BEGGING him to let him use the charger she using because only two of the three chargers (EA) were actually functioning properly. That's the same location that has two other CCS chargers (which were occupied) and 24 Tesla Superchargers. If she could have used the Tesla Supercharger network that would have never even been an issue. \n\nI think that I've come to the consensus that an EV w/ a 300+ mile EPA rated range is pretty much the minimum I'd want to shoot for currently IF I planned on consistently taking road-trips. That should realistically enough range to get at least 250 miles of range in ideal conditions at 75 miles per hour and 200ish miles of range in the winter. Every mile more than that and every additional charger beyond that makes it even more ideal. \n\nAll I can say is that I cannot wait until the Ariya and Solterra have supercharger access.

I was driving from the Sand Dunes national park to Denver (roughly Alamosa, CO) in March this year.\n\nOne positive on this trip was I took a 10 minute detour to one of the only TOTALLY FREE DCFC chargers I\'ve ever seen, just outside of Alamosa.  But after that it got weird.\n\nI drove past the nice reliable 8-plug supercharger in Alamosa, then past the 8-plug supercharger in Poncha Springs, CO and had to take a 25 minute detour to charge in Salida. Turns out the charger there has only one plug and it was working at something like 40kw. We charged for 30 minutes, but decided to carry on at like 35% charge.\n\n(Edit:  Note, I\'ve seen that a ""dealership"" based 100kw charger did open up this summer in Salida - though I think it\'s behind a gate some of the time)\n\nI saw the charger in Buena Vista was EXTREMELY expensive ($1.33/kwh?!?!), so we decided to go on to Fairplay, CO.\n\nI pulled in there to find the two plug charger had a Leaf and a Bolt at it with a Rivian and a Hyundai waiting in line. I knew it was 65kw when shared between two cars, so I was doing some mental math that it would only be a long ass wait. (I\'d never waited for a supercharger in 4 years of having a Tesla).\n\nWe found another on Highway 285 down near Confier and decided I could make it (arriving with under 10% charge). Since I was running late to be home for dinner, I decided to go for it.\n\nWe got to the charger in Conifer, Co and one station was blocked and the other just wouldn\'t connect to the car, despite a 30 minute call to ChargePoint and a ton of troubleshooting. I just checked on Plugshare and it\'s the only fast charger in that corridor, but it\'s offline today and hasn\'t been faster than 40kw in over a year.\n\nAt that point, I\'m regretting not waiting for 45 minutes in Fairplay. By my math, we\'d already be charging, I was stuck maybe spending the night in the car to try to trickle charge off an exterior outlet of a gas station or something. There is a 10 plug supercharger with 100% uptime a few blocks away, but that didn\'t help us in a Kia.\n\nI noticed there was a charger we\'d passed that was down the hill from us (Bailey, CO). I\'d previously been filtering below 100kw, but it\'s only 60kw. It\'s also the WRONG way, but I was out of options by then.\n\nSo we drove the wrong way (away from home) to get to the charger. It worked, but was limited to 45kw for some reason.\n\nAfter we waited for a bit I realized we needed 1.5 hours more charging to get to our destination.

Don't talk about the environmental benefits, or performance, or any of that. Just focus on money. 'With this car it costs me 10 cents to commute to work, with my last car it was over a dollar a day!'

If they keep pressing me on it, I'll go further into the finances. I like to mention that my Model 3 cost only $25k (after incentives and selling a previous car, which was also an EV). Its cheaper than a Corolla, and much nicer. When they bring up challenges with charging, I'll mention that I mostly charge at home, and for roadtrips the car plans out the charging stops for me.

They have the friends they have, watch the news they watch, see the content their social media feeds them. \n\nAlso, there is a big organized misinformation campaign at work by parts of the auto industry (Toyota is a big funder of anti EV propaganda) and the oil and gas sector feeding a steady stream of reasons to fear EVs, doubt the benefits, and be uncertain about their value.\n\nThis is further complicated by the US (and Canadian) current political landscape, with some politicians jumping on opportunities to widen division and foster a sense of ""the other side"" being a big danger to drive voting behaviour; so there is an entirely separate set of perverse incentives at work even on top of the fossil and legacy auto industries are doing.\n\nEVs are better, which you probably can feel by now.

But not nice enough to carry one around all the time.\n\nNone of that stopped the wave. \n\nSimilarly some of the anti EV arguments are true in isolation.\n\nYou *do* see more gas stations out there. It just doesn\'t matter as much, because you\'re not going to a gas station twice a week anymore. For most EV owners we are charging at home 50 weeks out of 52.\n\nBattery replacements *are* crazy expensive. But most EV drivers won\'t ever need a battery replacement. For the remaining few that do, most of those happen under warranty, and the EV driver isn\'t out of pocket. And an EV battery that only holds 60% of its original charge can be sold to be reconditioned to use as a house battery or even recycled. It\'s not like a fossil car, where a worn out engine is only scrap value.\n\nYou can refuel a gas car faster (for now) than I can charge on the highway. But that doesn\'t matter, because it turns out I like to take a twenty minute break every two or three hours of driving. Plus, I timed how long it takes me to plug in my car for an overnight charge. It\'s 18 seconds, and it requires no driving off my route (and I don\'t end up buying a candy bar and a soda pop). \n\nAnd, while there aren\'t many BlackBerrys still in use, landlines didn\'t really go anywhere. Niche product now, not ubiquitous anymore, but still around. I suspect hobbyists will have classic Mustangs, GTOs, Impalas (even 280z, air cooled 911s) etc in garages for a while.

"Rant: Charging Experience for 500mi Road Trip, Or Why I Want to Go Back to Horsedrawn Carriages","I'm a professional User Experience designer. This experience caused anger for me in a way I'm not sure many people would understand. It's just incompetence. That's it. These are bad experiences we've had solutions for FOR DECADES. 

 Apps **REQUIRED** to complete my road trip:

- Plugshare (to find chargers, Google maps often misses them)

Then, to charge at various chargers, each with own accounts to set up, half with having to ""load"" cash on a prepaid card which means I just have cash sitting in this arbitrary account that I can't do anything with, and only half accept credit cards:

- Chargepoint

- CircleK Charging

- EVGo

- Shell Recharge

- Electrify America

- Francis Energy 

Experience: 2/5. Chaos, frustration, stupidity. 

**Night Time Usability:** None of the pumps had sufficient lighting so I was often out in the dark with my flashlight trying to see what the hell I'm supposed to do. 

**System Status**: Then, the apps show them working, but upon visiting, it's out of commission--or the speed is not as advertised. 

**Misleading Speed:** My favorite are the ""xkW (Shared)"" chargers. They're actually half the speed they advertise. It's Megabit/Megabyte all over again. Intentionally misleading. 

**Appaggeddon:** I'm coming from this as a former Tesla owner where all of those apps above are replaced with: The Tesla App. Nothing else. All of these apps you see need to have account information, payment information. Etc. 

**Hello Year 2008:** Not only that, but **they don't even support auto fill of your payment methods.** Here I am in the dark, getting rained on, angling my credit card to the light so I can see and manually type in my credit card information, like a god damn neanderthal. 

**Tap Card, But Not That One:** They have these great features where you can tap your credit card to charge. Oh wait. No they don't! Actually, it's some kind of dumb ass membership card. No credit card machine. But it doesn't say that at all until you try to tap, and it runs your card, then spits out ""no account found."". Nice job, guys. Excellent work as always. Keep it up. 

**We're the Main Character:**

It was clear that every company is trying to reinvent the same solution over and over again with some boneheaded stupidity thrown into it or some kind of ""hey look at me with my cool app!"". I don't care! It's a piece of shit. You don't know how to make apps. You don't know why you should make apps. This isn't 2009 where apps are novel. I'll use your pump once on the way, then a different company, then a different company. The infrastructure doesn't support me going ""well I only use Chargepoint *pushes up glasses* because they have the most pure electrons"". 

**Thank God You Have QR Codes:**

Jesus fuck. The QR codes spit out a four or five digit NUMERIC code. Are you FUCKING kidding me? What is the point?!?! Of all things to give me a QR code for, typing four or five god damn digits is the least of my problems with these idiotic machines. No, absolutely not, why would you think to give me a QR code to easily install your dumbass app? Nah, that'd be silly. 

**Get BP+, to Raise Your BP:**

I don't want an app for my gas station. You're not offering me a service that's improved by the app whatsoever, other than you harvesting my data. You're not a tech company. No one cares about you. It's a pain in the ass to fuck with. 

It's effectively a gas pump. That's it. It's not hard. Just make a fucking gas pump for electricity. My God. 

**To be absolutely clear: this isn't ""anti-EV"". This is anti runaway capitalism, or put another way: anti-idiocy. We effectively have hundreds of micro governments each equally as inept as the previous one.** This is not Anti-EV. It's Anti-Charging Company. They fucking suck. All of them. All. Of. Them.

**The Future:**

Hopefully this new infrastructure bill fixes this bullshit. But I have never been more frustrated trying to have a road trip. Just insanity. If I'm not mistaken, the new bill includes requirements for the pumps to have credit card swipers. That alone will improve this experience by ten fold.

"2 years with a Mach e, sold for a Tesla sorry sub but hear me out","So we spent two years with our FE Mach E and while it was great, the charging situation was absolutely abysmal here in the Midwest. We regularly drive from STL to various areas within 4 hours and the EA chargers have gotten worse and worse. There are now always minimum of 1 charger down and/or one that only gets 40kw max for seemingly no reason. We were lucky enough to at least have 110V snail charging at home which was good enough with our gas car combined.
We sold both vehicles and are down to the one model3 and it’s just.. better. In every way. The mobile app works. Charging is definitely more full at the super chargers but haven’t had a problem yet, and they work as advertised. The screen and ui just.. work. No bugs. The Tesla actually recognizes which driver is getting in the driver seat, something the Mach e failed to do 70% of the time. Seats are more comfy, ride quality itself is better. I’ve heard all the horror stories of Tesla fitment issues and I can honestly say this car has not one single issue. No rattling, no panel gaps, no software issues, no phantom braking, nothing. I’m very glad we switched, charging on the road is incredibly more convenient now and while I love so many other evs and which I could buy them (ev6, gv60, Porsche, etc) I refuse to until the charging network is built properly.",1120,"['This is the state of the Midwest.', '[deleted]', 'Marques Brownlee just put up a YouTube post about charging infrastructure yesterday.

Even though I only take a couple long trips a year, nothing ruins a trip more than the shitty experience of fast charging on a CCS network that\'s always broken.\n\nSince picking up a model S, I\'ve taken one long trip and it was an absolute breeze.

Having something that doesn't work well is worse then not having it at all.   In this case the traditional automakers are fucked in 2023 because you can compare it to something else just as I have.   And what you find isn't that pretty for those traditional companies.  They need to get their ass in gear or they are going to look more and more like old people who just can't keep up in this new world.\n\nSo your complaints were the same as my complaints about the 3 in 2018/2019 just that there was nothing else to compare it to other then the Leaf I came from.  Even that was far better then the Leaf.   So for me even the minor issues weren't a massive deal.  My car didn't even have intermittent wipers when I got it and it was added after.   Still far better the the Leaf that had them.  But it isn't 2018 but 2023 and now you have a far better and more mature product with the Tesla then before and those companies have to show their product can compete against that not what they were doing 4 years ago.\n\nAgain this isn't a fanboy thing.  I have used the products.  I know that there still isn't another car I can buy to get the same experience as I do with a Tesla in the way I want to.    I use my app all the time to preheat the car.  If I switch to one where i have to fight with that 20% of the time then it will drive me crazy because I know it can work so much better.  So I won't switch until I see something that will actually work as well.   You an call that being a fanboy but I just call that having 30 years of driving experience and knowing exactly what I want out of a car.

NACS can use any protocol, it is the same exact wires as CCS, but in a more compact arrangement.  Tesla cars have a universal charging circuit that supports any charging protocol globally.  The protocol of the charger does not matter.  A tesla can plug into a CCS charger with a NACS cable or a CCS cable with a NACS adapter and work just fine using the CCS protocol.  Other car manufacturers should be using similar universal charging circuits that they standardize for all their cars in all markets, it just makes sense to reduce cost.\n\nNACS also supports up to 1000kw, CCS is only 350kw.  A new version of CCS coming out in 2025, only supports 500kw.  It still requires swapping out every charger which no one is going to do.  \n\nThe current upper charging speed limit on the tesla v4 chargers isn't even known publicly.  No one knows what tesla plans to do, but it is likely that the charging hardware all supports high wattages, even if they initially use smaller grid connections and offer around 300-350kw.  Upgrading the speed in the future will likely be an electrical service upgrade without changing the charger hardware out."", ""Meh, it's not really holding back EV adoption since it has no power to suppress Tesla.

And not just lone chargers. Charging stations with 4+ stalls that offer 150kW+ charging. Only EA is offering that along many midwest routes.\n\nI **never** said it wasn\'t, I am simply pointing out that claiming there are no charging options at all is not an accurate portrayal of the current charging network. And that many of us are getting by just fine on what is currently available. It doesn\'t mean we shouldn\'t make it better, but at least be honest about it.', 'Where are you guys finding the Freewire chargers? Just curious what part of the country is getting the first phase of gas station chargers.', 'Yeah I’ve had a much different experience on a lot of trips. I live in the south SF Bay and have family in LA in the South and Redding up north, going south there are more charging options (still not enough) but a ton of EVs, and going north there are only a handful of stations between Vacaville and the Oregon border and they’re all pretty crappy.', ""I mostly agree with you. I'm happy about the Pilot/EVGo partnership because they have stations in good locations on some routes that I do pretty regularly.

Even the Bolt owner on 8 February said so.\n\n>The vast majority of EV drivers (or drivers in general) aren't taking such regular road trips that chargers away from their house are much of a concern. And when they do need to take a road trip it's an acceptable delay because of all the other perks.\n\nGuna disagree with you there. American's want road trip capable EVs, whether or not they actually take road trips that often. In fact, [charging concerns](https://www.exro.com/industry-insights/barriers-to-electric-vehicle-adoption-in-2022#:~:text=affordability%20of%20EVs.-,Charging%20Infrastructure,and%20charging%20variance%20by%20vehicles.) is probably the biggest reasons Americans are hesitant about EVs.\n\n>I own a bolt, you act like a 50kw charger is dramatically slower than what I see literally everywhere and have no problems with whatsoever.

It absolutely is dramatically shower than what most EVs sold in the US are capable of today. Most drivers already don't want to trade 5 minute gas stops every 400 miles for 30 minute charging stops every 200 or so miles. If you're really content with spending an hour per stop with the Bolt doing the same, then you are in the small minority.\n\nBut even if you ignore the slow charge rate, one stall isn't sufficient as a stop between large cities. Most drivers don't want to load the family up for a trip to the grandparents on the hope that the lone 50kW charging stall in Lima is working and un-occupied. Again, okay as a backup.

The crux of the argument is that it makes users wait more? Charging isn’t a public service it’s a business.

It’s the same thing with gas you know, people pump for 6 mins then go into the store and park their car there for 15. The gas stations want that to happen so they can make money on sodas and snacks.

Kia bongo 3 EV charging problem ,"Kia bongo 3 ev charging problem

Hi everyone I have a Kia bongo 3 ev 2021 model and it drives me crazy every time i put it on charge it disconnect and doesn't show anything on screen the charger (A 32 Ampere wall charger) only says ""paused"".

When charging in ev station it disconnect for a few times also not showing anything on screen.

The car works fine and the battery last as it's expected.

I have tested the charger i own on my other ev 2020 bongo 3 and it charge normally.

Any ideas on how to fix this issue",3,"['Is there some kind of scheduling available in the charging menu in the car?', ""you might want to check for recalls, some Kia EV's have been recalled for charging problems."", 'I checked and it\'s set to ""off"" \nSame on the charger']",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1f7x02k/kia_bongo_3_ev_charging_problem/
My EV is now 10 years old. Pros and Cons of owning an EV long-term.,"Specifically, I own a 2014 Tesla Model S 85 and live in the suburbs of a southeastern US city.

**The good news:**

* **Range:** Battery was originally rated at 265 miles and got about 245 in real world driving conditions. Today, it will show about 240 miles of range at a full charge and will actually go about 215-220. So, only about 10% degradation over 10 years. I should note that the car has been in a warm, southeastern climate for its entire life so far. Granted, there are several new EVs that will go 300+ miles on a single charge, but just in terms of degradation, it hasn't been bad at all. Also, I find that I only take about 2 trips per year that require more range than my car provides. On those trips, we take my wife's ICE SUV, but it really wouldn't be that big a deal if we only owned EVs. We could plan our trips accordingly or just rent a car for long trips.
* **Tech still seems modern:** I assumed my car would quickly become a dinosaur as newer models would offer features that blew mine away. But that hasn't been the case, at least not yet. Although I just have auto-pilot rather than full self-driving, I don't feel like its dated. Granted, I upgraded to the new infotainment system a few years ago when I had to replace the main touchscreen, but the old one was still pretty useful. Navi, streaming media, autopilot, lots of remote features, keyless entry and start, backup camera, lane departure warnings and traffic sensors, heated seats, power everything, programmable, auto-folding mirrors, voice commands for most apps, etc. are all reasonably close to what new cars have to offer, except that I don't have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. That said, I tend to use Tesla's navi and streaming services anyway, so it's no biggie. Plus, it helps that, as long as you don't need new hardware, the software upgrades and bug fixes can be downloaded remotely and automatically.
* **Charging:** I own a home and therefore have easy access to level 2 charging in my garage. I rarely need a supercharger, but when I do, they seem to be plentiful and easy to find. Supercharging does take longer than a stop at a gas station and speed depends on how many others are charging at the same time, but it usually takes me about 40-45 mins to go from 20-80%. A ton of charging stations are located in places where you can shop or eat while you wait, and I've never had to wait more than a couple mins for a spot to open-up. Plus, there are apps that will tell you whether the supercharging station has open slots that aren't already in use. Also, having adapters means I can use whatever network is available. Plus, I must be grandfathered or something because I've never paid for a charge at a Tesla station. It's always been free.
* **Driving experience:** The overall experience of driving an EV is, in my opinion, superior to an ICE vehicle and that's not just true of Teslas, but for many other brands and models I've driven as well. It's smooth, quiet, acceleration is exceptional, handling tends to be very nimble, there's little or no body lean in the turns, it climbs hills with ease, and aside from the fire risk associated with lithium ion batteries, they tend to be safer in accidents, probably because there's no engine in front of the driver which I assume allows the entire front of the car to act as a crumple zone.
* **Shorter commutes:** This is more a product of government incentives than the car itself, but I live in an area with a lot of toll or HOV lanes that I can access, for free, as an EV owner, even when I'm the only one in the car. That significantly reduces my commute time in heavy traffic.
* **Brakes are still good:** The car is 10 years old, yet I haven't had to replace the brakes because I don't use them much. With regenerative breaking, it's almost a one-foot driving experience.

**The bad news:**

* **Expensive, out-of-warranty repairs:** It's amazing how everything seems to go wrong once the warranty expires, and I've had to replace both the 17"" main touchscreen and the driver instrument cluster due to faulty glue on the screen that eventually bubbles and seeps out. I also had to spend more than you would expect to fix a squeaky rear suspension and I had a couple minor issues like a door handle that wouldn't ""present"" and excessive vibration in the sound system which I fixed myself. In total, I've probably spent just shy of $6,000 on repairs and all of that has been within the last 4 years. But, over the 10-year lifespan of the car so far, maybe that's about normal since all my issues are mechanical or electronic rather than having any engine repairs.
* **Tire life:** My car goes through tires almost twice as fast as my ICE cars have. Seems to be a common issue for EV owners due to the increased weight.
* **Service:** It can take weeks or even a month to get a service appointment and the service centers are so backed-up that they often don't have loaners available. This experience may improve with the brands that have dealerships all over the country and especially when we get to a point where parts are available through your local garage and there are actually enough trained mechanics. But for now, Tesla owners rely almost entirely on the Tesla service centers and DIY. Fortunately, (knock on wood), I've never had an issue where my car was undrivable, so waiting for weeks to get service has been more of an annoyance than anything debilitating.
* **Others can't hear you:** I've adjusted to this over time, but when navigating parking lots or other congested areas with lots of pedestrians, it's important to remember that they can't hear you because the car is silent. To this day, I frequently experience situations where someone will be walking in front of my car, just completely oblivious that I'm even there. It's a safety issue and can be a tad annoying in terms of parking lot etiquette.

**Neutral:**

* **Total cost of ownership:** This is a moving target due to increased competition, changes in federal rebate programs, an unpredictable resale market, widely fluctuating gas and home electricity prices, etc. But for the most part, I think long-term EV ownership has come out about even with an ICE vehicle in the same class. The higher up-front purchase price and higher cost for mechanical repairs and insurance have been offset by savings on gas, tolls, and oil changes and the lack of engine maintenance. I'm interested to see how this plays-out for vehicles that get into the 200,000+ mile range, but I tend to think EVs will perform well, even in old-age. After all, the batteries are designed to go 500,000 miles and, with no engine repairs, the vehicle itself should hold-up well over time. The downside is that, with so many new EV models hitting the market over the next few years, and car companies being aggressive to drive adoption and market share, that could erode resale values for older EVs. But we'll see.

**Overall verdict:**

* It has its pros and cons, especially since I own an early generation model that probably hadn't had all the bugs and problems worked-out yet, but I find EVs in general to just be a superior technology to ICE vehicles, and when I eventually replace my current EV, which may still be 2-3 years from now, I plan to get another one.",802,"['Good write up.

Interesting to compare.\n\n**Good news comparison:**\n\n * **Range**: Rated for 262 miles when I bought it (78k miles). However the range drop isn't as great as seems, because there was an infamous software update that nerfed the reported range of the 85 - Tesla were taken to court in Norway about this and lost. For me - pre-software update, 262 miles. Post-software update, zero extra miles added change...235 miles. I get about 215 miles of real range as well, so that tracks very closely.\n * **Tech still seems modern**: *Mostly*, but the navigation is archaic. No waypoints, no camera detection, no lane advice, poor reception means maps often don't download...not great. The rest I completely agree. I did the 3G->LTE modem upgrade too.\n * **Charging:** Great for me. I'm in the UK, so had the cheap CCS2 retrofit applied and it's fine. Slightly annoying to use an adapter but nothing I care about. Here though is one point that I think newer cars will win on - older cars like this take longer to charge than newer ones.\n * **Brakes are still good:** Yes, all good. I did find the wheels warped though, that's more due to the 'quality' of roads I have to use. So I replaced the wheels.\n * **Shorter commute:** Change this to commuting experience and I agree. I drive into central London and do about 90 miles a day round trip. No ULEZ (pollution toll), no congestion toll. Also I love the fact I don't stop at garages anymore - used to have to do that a fair amount. \n * **Driving experience:** Here we diverge. I agree with everything except 'nimble, no body roll'. I should note I came off cars like the 911, Boxster, started my driving life in a British Leyland Mini 1000...the Model S has all the roll you would expect of a large non-sports car. In many respects it is similar to the [Jaguar XJ40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XJ_\\(XJ40\\)#/media/File:1989_Jaguar_Sovereign_\\(6368338167\\).jpg) I once had in the 90s - fantastic cruiser, but sports it is not. I should note I have the Air Suspension which might affect things a little. Ride quality is good though.\n * **Bonus Extra addition - storage:** Phenomenal. I can store more than I could in my previous estate car. The car took two labradors and a smaller dog in the boot (trunk) without issue. These days it carries a St Bernard and that same smaller dog - again, no issue. The frunk is much larger on these than on the modern ones, and that suits me fine. I can put a week's worth of family groceries in the frunk, dogs in the back, four or five people in the car...zero issues. Plus I love the yacht floor approach vs the central console in newer ones - much more spacious.\n\n\n**Bad news comparison:**\n\n * **Expensive, out-of-warranty repairs**: Can't really relate. Zero non-warranty repairs beyond two light bulbs. That said, I made sure to get a lot done while it was in warranty - the screen repair due to glue is a recall for instance, and shouldn't have been charged for at all (OP - you might want to look into this). I will say an odd one though - recently activation of my horn has been unreliable. It always sounds, but usually now is a single tone rather than double. Do not want them to start taking the steering wheel apart and charge for airbags etc. to find out why, so am a bit concerned about raising the issue.\n * **Tyre Life (hey, I'm in the UK...):** Agreed though maybe not *quite* as bad. Depends what ICE you came from. My 996 911 for instance had *heard* of the concept of tyre longevity but didn't really agree with it. Same could be said for an XJR 350 I had.\n * **Service**: Now this is hit or miss for me. *In general* I'm happy. Some of the quotes though...bit wide of the mark, and it can be an amount of time for an appointment as OP mentioned. I had a quote of £1.3k for a headlamp. Nope, the actual cost was £65 - they'd quoted for replacing LED headlamp unit when this car still has halogens. I had a warranty issue with the air suspension compressor becoming very noisy - common issue, but took two service centres to comprehend it and an utter age to fix it. But recent experience has been fine for me.\n * **Others can't hear you**: Yeah, I got used to this very quickly but agreed. \n\n**Neutral news comparison:**\n\n * **Total cost of ownership**: Definitely a difference here, because it's been phenomenally positive for me. Literally saved tens of thousands of pounds. Again, depends what you're coming off. High end ICE services were starting to cost £1.5k regularly due to various issues. This has been ultra-reliable, doesn't require regular service at all, and the combination of cheap home charging plus free Supercharging for life on this model means I am just coining it in in comparison to my ICE days. My original rationale for the car was economic - I worked it out on a spreadsheet vs retaining my existing ICE (at that time a family car, so had a BMW F11 M5 Touring diesel. Expensive doesn't begin to cut it - the thing went through suspension issues like they were going out of fashion. Which, in fact, they were).\n\n**Overall verdict comparison:**\n\n * Completely agree with the overall verdict. For me the car keeps making too good a case for itself to consider replacing it. The only thing tempting me to other cars is charging speed, but I'm not shelling out for a new car just to speed up 0.5% of my journeys by twenty minutes."", 'Just a comment on the ""others can\'t hear you"" do all Tesla\'s not come with a pedestrian warning noise?

"What I test drove, what I bought, and why","I just bought my first EV (yay!) and thought I would share my shopping experience in case it helps anyone. It's long...

Importantly, if I lived somewhere other than where I am now, I might have made a different choice. I lived in San Diego for quite a few years, and now live in western Mass. Might have made different choices if I was still in SD.

What we looked at/drove:

1a. Hyundai Ioniq 5. The first to look at... we didn't drive it the first time because my husband veto'd it. He thought it was too small (it's not) and was still not sold on 100% electric. More on this later.

1b. We also looked at the Santa Fe PHEV at the same dealer. The trim felt a bit cheap, but I wasn't really serious about it because I knew I would eventually win the all EV battle. 

2. Volkswagen ID.4. Also didnt drive. I liked the look of it, husband didn't like the trim. For a small SUV/crossover, the trunk seemed a bit small for golf clubs. Dealership seemed really invested in selling EVs - they had a EV specialist that was busy when we were there, but even the non-specialist seemed very well informed. Husband was still holding out for PHEV, so he might have just been grumpy when we looked at it.

3. Nissan Ariya. First one I drove, took out the FWD version. More than any other car, it felt like an ICE. Both in the interior appointments (which maybe some folks like) but also in the driving feel. Sure, it was zippyier than our ICE, but I expected a bit more and was kinda disappointed. I suspect the AWD might have felt better. A rare FWD instead of RWD for an EV non-AWD version. No ""real"" one pedal driving. I wasn't sold for these reasons....
(The very young salesman did tell us a nice story during our drive about how last summer he hitchhiked all through western Mass because he was growing weed in the forest). 

4. Ford Mustang Mach e AWD. I really liked this car. A lot. Really, really a lot. It was definitely the experience I expected and wanted from an EV while driving. The seats themselves were probably the most comfortable. Nice large screen, but still with tactile buttons. Plenty of storage. They only had high end models that were $65k plus. They also had an EV specialist, who clearly LOVED cars, including his own Mach E, and honestly was indifferent about selling cars - he just knew a lot and loved his, and would happily chat cars and EVs all day long. Pretty good experience. Really, the only negative was price point (especially since MA has a rebate for cars under $55k only). 

At this point, I (and salesman) have inundated my husband with enough info he is willing to go all electric.

5. Tesla Model Y AWD LR. Really fun car to drive. Seats felt a bit stiff/uncomfortable to me, and I really hated that there was no console over the steering wheel with basic info like speed (which the S and X both have). The center screen is very nice, but it felt distracting to the point of unsafe to have to look to my right to see and/or change anything. Lots of storage space. The price point is almost unbeatable now, with the price drop plus state and federal rebates. And of course the fast charge network is unparalleled. Other than the fact that Elon Musk is completely nutter butters, my other concern is that the closet service center is 2 hours from my house. While I know they are mostly remote for service, I had a concern that if I did need work done at a service center, it would mean taking a whole day off work. I almost bought this car though, regardless.

6. Kia EV6. This was also very comfortable and was very fun to drive. In a lot of ways, felt similar to the Mach E, but I liked the Mach E better. Salesman here was a bit clueless. I asked about one pedal driving, and he said ""what do you mean?"". I asked him ""you know, when you don't use the brake?"" He looked absolutely horrified and said ,""uh, you have to use the brake"". In the end, it was nice, but too pricey to justify over the Tesla.

7. Subaru Solterra (& Toyota bZ4X). Longtime Subaru ICE owners, so had to check this out. Also felt sluggish, similar to the Ariya. No glovebox really frustrated my husband (whatever). All the cars have voice control, but I liked saying ""Hey Subaru, turn on the heat"" instead of hitting a button first. But, feeling so sluggish, never really considered it - especially since they had none in stock and expected a 4 month wait. The Toyota is the same car - also none in stock.

8. Volvo C40 and XC40. Didn't drive, just looked at/sat in. We didn't drive them because they were so much pricier than the Tesla it was hard to justify, but they were really nice. Felt very premium and comfy inside. If you want a nice vehicle, I would drive it. Felt a step up from both the Mach E and Kia which were plenty nice IMO.

9. Genesis GV60. Didn't drive this either, for the same reason - it's a premium car and I just couldn't justify the price - but the differences, sitting in it were noticeable. 

10/1. Ioniq 5  AWD SEL (again!). So we were at the joint Hyundai/Genesis dealership kicking tires and a salesman came and started chatting. We said we were gonna go Tesla (more or less decided at that point, despite my dislike of the interface and 2 hr drive. Salesman tells us about a $7500 manufacturer rebate... which puts this into range of the Tesla. My husband is less grumpy about all electric now, and suddenly the car is much more appealing to him, size-wise. (He put his golf clubs in the back on the test drive and was well satisfied, they can fit crosswise no problem).

We test drove it, and it felt good. I liked the console a lot more than the Tesla, and had  a good experience at the dealership. They seemed knowledgeable about the car. Will let me use their lvl2 and lvl3 chargers for free. (Free EA charging isn't that useful for me in my area, unless I drive into Boston I guess). 

Now owners of a Ioniq 5 AWD SEL and absolutely love it. Feels good driving, I like the console, plenty of rear storage.

If I lived in a city (like SD) that was close to a Tesla service center, I might have bought a Tesla right away, in spite of Elon and console, but I am very happy (so far!) with my decision. If the Mach E had a dealer incentive/model to bring it to 55k,  I would have got that - really loved the feel of that car. The Tesla & Mach E felt the most ""zippy"" on the road to me, with the EV6 and Ioniq very close behind. The Solterra and Ariya were noticeably sluggish, comparatively speaking.",765,"[""Sounds like you really did your due diligence.

I thought the Ioniq 5 was the best all rounder (confortable, great interior/boot space when compared to car size, superb visibilty), but my wife liked the Ioniq 6 interior a bit more and with range in mind we ended up ordering that."", 'We went through a similar process, except we test drove each time. Our sequence was: VW ID.4, Hyundai Kona, Ioniq 5&6, Nissan Ariya, Kia Niro, EV6, Toyota zb4x, Tesla 3LR.\n\nAfter trying all those, we knew we wanted an EV, and we narrowed it to 4 and did more research, which had it still too close to call between the ID.4, Ariya, Ioniq, and EV6.\n\nAt that point, I felt about the same as you about the Ariya, and was leaning towards the EV6.\n\nBut then we test drove them again, and that had us liking the ID.4 and Nissan for the interior feel and comfort.\n\nWe ended up getting an Ariya FWD. I had had the same first impression about it feeling a bit like an ICE automatic SUV . . . but after driving it a bit more, I no longer feel that way. It just took a little getting used to, but the abundant effortless power and handling are there, and I now really love how it drives and feels, now that I am used to it. Just saying.', 'I think it was a good choice, the Ioniq 5, because it charges fast and looks cool. Honestly though, they have a lot of problems from the charge management electronics bricking to the charging port overheating and derating charge rates. Lots of nightmares there.

In a lot of ways, felt similar to the Mach E, but I liked the Mach E better. Salesman here was a bit clueless. I asked about one pedal driving, and he said ""what do you mean?"". I asked him ""you know, when you don\'t use the brake?"" He looked absolutely horrified and said ,""uh, you have to use the brake"". In the end, it was nice, but too pricey to justify over the Tesla.\n\nFor the Kia it\'s called ipedal mode. I don\'t use it because the Kia has blended braking, so it\'ll use regen when you press on the brake pedal. \n\nAlso the Mach E has a thermal issue with the motor, leading to it dropping power if running hard for any sort of real time. The EV6 doesn\'t have that same issue. Watch some of the EV youtubers that get press cars to test out and they\'ll talk about it a bit in the comparisons between the two. \n\nThe Mach E also starts limiting the power output pretty high up in the state of charge, and has a pretty low torque drop off. EV6 will let you run it hard until the battery is empty and it\'s torque drop off is greater than the governor limited top speed\n\nI can\'t really speak on any of the other vehicles specifically, other than Tesla\'s have a build quality issue that\'s persisted for over a decade.', 'Nice rundown.

I drove from California to New Jersey without using Superchargers,"TL;DR: The CCS network certainly has room to improve but it's adequate for a cross-country coast-to-coast drive. Electrify America never left us stranded and never made us wait a long time. I've only experienced one derated Electrify America stuck at 90kW but it was easy to switch. And L2 chargers are underrated. ABRP is reliable and can be fully trusted. The car's onboard navigation is consistently more pessimistic than ABRP and can also be trusted; we learned to like using the onboard navigation for its prediction of arrival battery SOC.

Long story: As part of a work-sponsored relocation, I needed to move from the Bay Area in California to Jersey City, NJ. My wife and I took turns driving our Ioniq 5, fully loaded with our luggage (the moving company took care of large pieces of furniture like mattresses but we brought about 6 suitcases worth of personal effects) and a cat and the cat's supplies. We also didn't take the shortest route, since we decided to visit some national parks in Utah and Colorado, as well as my wife's alma mater, UIUC.

We almost entirely used Electrify America, except for three occasions on Tesla destination chargers and three on L2 ChargePoints. My car actually cannot use NACS-enabled Superchargers yet, and originally I thought I would have to use some Magic Dock Superchargers but that turned out not to be the case. I used Electrify America a total of 24 times according to the app (more in reality due to some EA chargers in free mode). None of my EA charging sessions exceeded 30 minutes. Most were about 12–15 minutes long. 

Here's the complete 14-day itinerary including charging stops.

* Day 1: I charged the car to 100% overnight at home. Due to the need to run some errands in the morning, when we started the road trip there was 90% left. The onboard navigation predicted that we would arrive at Harris Ranch EA at 17%, but due to significant traffic congestion we arrived at 35%. EA performed well, giving me 244kW max. Ordered burgers at the restaurant but unfortunately the car reached 80% before the burger was ready. Unplugged as soon as the burger was ready, at 91%. Then drove to an Airbnb in Bakersfield with Tesla destination charger. Charged to 100% overnight. 

* Day 2: We drove from Bakersfield to Baker and arrived at 25% SOC. That Electrify America was glorious with very needed canopy. 12 chargers in total, 3 available. Charged to 89% at 177kW maximum. Then drove to our hotel in Las Vegas, arriving with 45% left. When we drove to a restaurant for dinner, we noticed a L2 ChargePoint nearby. While we had dinner, we charged to 66%. Then we drove back to the hotel at 65%. We didn't charge at any EA in Las Vegas area due to how congested they were. Honestly the L2 ChargePoint was essential in retrospect: if we couldn't charge in Las Vegas the battery would be awfully low when we got to the next EA.

* Day 3: We left the hotel at 65% and arrived at the EA in Mesquite, NV at 25%. The 350kW chargers were occupied so we plugged into the 150kW. It gave us 173kW which was fast enough. We used the restroom in the adjoining Walmart and ordered takeout from Subway. By the time we got the subway order the car was at 92%. We then drove to yet another EA at Telegraph, UT and charged to 95%. We thought we would drive to Zion and then Bryce Canyon along U.S. 89 which has no charging, so we charged here almost to full (ABRP said charge to 100%), but we changed our plans later on and decided to visit the Kolob Canyons area. 

* Day 4: We didn't drive at all. Took the NPS shuttle to Zion and back to Springdale. 

* Day 5: We drove from the hotel to Kolob Canyon and then to the EA at Cedar City, UT. Arriving at the charger at 44% and charged to 94%. Again the limiting factor was the slow subway order at Walmart. We didn't need to charge that long because we booked a hotel with Tesla destination chargers (Best Western Plus Ruby's Inn). Fortunately no one was waiting for the EA charger. Drove to Bryce Canyon National Park along the scenic drive and then checked in to the hotel at 60%. Charged to 100% in the evening. Took the NPS shuttle back into the park: the shuttle is more convenient than driving because one could start the hike at one shuttle stop and end at another without making it a full loop. I also appreciated taking a break from driving and letting a professional bus driver do it.

* Day 6: We started from the hotel at 100%, passed through Capitol Reef National Park, drove by a couple of attractions there and ended up at the Green River EA with 41% left. Charged to 80% and left for Moab, UT. Arrived in Moab, UT and visited a lot of places in Arches National Park. Charged to 90% at the newly opened Electrify America (RMP Moab) on the way back to the hotel. This charging station actually opened just a few weeks ago. If we had started the trip a few weeks earlier, we would have to find some other way to charge.

* Day 7: Drove to Canyonlands National Park, Island in the Sky district in the morning for some hikes. Passed by the same EA and topped up from 60% to 90%, and then drove to the Needles District to see some amazing views. Drove back to the hotel. During this drive I noticed the steering wheel shaking whenever the speed was above 55mph: it's a known issue probably because of the foam in the Michelin tires. Found a nice tire shop on Yelp. The tire shop was closed for the day so decided to go to the tire shop first thing in the morning for a balance. 

* Day 8: Went to the tire shop just when they open. Unfortunately there was already a line of people with tire problems. Waited a bit and did the balance. Then charged one last time at Moab to 83% and left for Alamosa, CO. The ABRP said to take the southerly route, but that route has two ChargePoint stations each with only two plugs and charges at 125kW max. I decided to take the I-70 instead with two Electrify America stations. Arrived at the EA in Grand Junction, CO with 36%. Walked to the other side of the street for Chick-fil-A. The Chick-fil-A was crowded. By the time I got the carry out order and walked back to the car it was at 99%. Fortunately no one was waiting. Drove to another EA in Edwards, CO. This time there was a short wait and it was actually the only time I waited at all in this trip. ABRP told us to charge to 90% which we did. We then drove to Alamosa, CO. On this drive we encountered the tire imbalance issue again. Charged the car to 100% at a nearby L2 ChargePoint for the night. 

* Day 9: I realized that if I visited a Michelin-recommended tire shop, they would be defending the quality of the tires and would refuse to remove the foam in the tires. I found a tire shop that does not sell Michelin tires at all. Finally the mechanic didn't try to convince us that the foam was fine and agreed to remove it. Did a balance and then drove to Great Sand Dunes National Park. Then drove to the Electrify America in Pueblo, CO, arriving at 51% and charged to 90%. ABRP said this leg would use a lot of energy but it turned out it wanted us to drive on the toll road E-470. But I didn't want the hassle of mailed toll notices so I endured Denver traffic. ABRP said I would make it to the next Electrify America at 20% but with traffic I arrived with 48%. Charged to 85% and drove to Estes Park, CO. 

* Day 10: Visited Rocky Mountain National Park for the whole day. Drove on the highest paved road in the contiguous United States and visited the highest NPS visitor center. Left the park and drove back to the hotel with 50% left. 

* Day 11: Drove east and stopped at the Electrify America at Fort Morgan, CO. The 350kW chargers were occupied so I used the 150kW. Arrived at 25% and charged to 85%. Next charging stop was in Ogallala, NE. Arrived at 45% and charged to 95% (actually ABRP asked me to charge to 98% but I decided to ignore that). The onboard navigation said I would not get to my next charging stop in Grand Island, NE. I in fact arrived with 27% left. Tried a charger but it stuck at 90kW; switched to a different one to get 160kW. To stay within EA's free charging rules, I made sure the combined charging time for both sessions did not exceed 30 minutes. Drove to the hotel in Grand Island for the night. 

* Day 12: Left the hotel. Arrived at the Electrify America in Council Bluffs, IA at 29%. Charged to 80%. Drove to the Electrify America at Brixmor Haymarket in Des Moines at 28%. Charged to 80% again. Drove to the Electrify America in Williamsburg, IA at 44% and charged to 80%. Drove to our hotel in Davenport and plugged in to the Tesla destination charger. I guess I was lucky because out of the two destination chargers, one was broken so there was only one working and it happened not to be occupied. Had a nice conversation with the hotel front desk (""you drive a Hyundai but you want to charge with Tesla?"")

* Day 13: Left the hotel with 100% charge. Arrived at the Electrify America in Champaign, IL at 24%. Charged to 80%. Parked near campus and walked around for a bit. The parking garage had a ChargePoint L2 so plugged in. When we finished the campus visit it was at 89%. Then drove to the EA in Indianapolis and charged to 90%. Drove to EA in Columbus, OH and charged from 30% to 80%. Drove to our hotel in Columbus with 75%.

* Day 14: Drove to the EA in Mansfield, Ohio. Charged from 54% to 92%. Charged at the EA in Clarion, PA and charged from 30% to 92% again. One final charge at the EA in Bloomsburg, PA from 35% to 92%. All these chargers were uneventful.",632,"['I’ve done it twice from San Diego to Boston and then back again.

No. Is there a place to walk your dog at this location?) but it was nearly perfect at telling me exactly how much I needed to charge at each stop, even considering the weather and elevation changes.

EV slowdown is because legacy manufacturers don't get it...,"I think part of the reason EV sales have slowed is because manufacturers still don't get it. 

I'm on my 2nd EV, hopefully soon to be 3rd, (plus an electric ATV) I live in a suburban part of rural Washington state and am from the middle of nowhere Montana, doesn't get much more rural than that. I still love driving an EV.

The reason sales have slowed is America doesn't trust the manufacturers.

EV owner frustrations are killing sales more than manufactures understand.  EV purchasers are more ""online"" than the public as a whole. This means current and prospective owners are perhaps likely to purchased or recommend a brand that has let us down. More likely to be brutally honest about our frustrations online where everyone can see it. This highly informs others decisions. 

VW has informally but publicly committed to software updates. Years in to their ID line, still have not really delivered. My FIL purchased my first EV, a 2021 ID.4. It has been at the dealership for 2 months waiting for the software update after it left him stranded on the side of the road. 

Promising EV's at 1 price and then raising it 50% before they hit the market even for those who reserved one, instant lost of trust. (Looking at you Ford and GM) 

They are willing to throw billions at new manufacturing but won't spend millions to keep promises. This is costing sales in way's they don't seem to understand. 

Stop offering vehicles with crap range and then being disappointed when owners roast you for it on youtube. You have 2 choices, offer a kick ass charging network or great range. If you don't do either, expect your sales to suck once you've burned through the enthusiastic early adopters. 

Charging sucks! NACS will help a lot, but where are the MFG commitments to offer a reasonably priced modification of current vehicles to NACS? I realize its a process but these are the largest companies in the world and you're trying to tell me they just can't figure it out? So many people are now waiting to purchase because of that one feature. And we have no faith that mfg will offer us a pathway to it with current vehicles. 

Electrify America is unreliable (looking at you VW) Almost every time I'm at an EA station at least one of the chargers doesn't work. Hell I've been at 4+ bay stations where only 1 charger worked. They could put way more effort into making the charging network reliable at way less cost than the manufacturing changes for the vehicles themselves. You want assurance your manufacturing investments will pay off, get your shit together and fix your charging networks. 

Honestly this list could go on. 

The worst part is Tesla showed them all exactly what to do to succeed before most of them even dipped their foot into the EV world, and none of them bothered to pay attention well enough to win from the valuable takeaways. The things Tesla does right + the quality control experience of legacy manufactures could have been a big win for them, and they flopped.

The car needs an internal switch that is not present on CCS cars.\n\nAn awkward external adapter with a manual or automatic switch for NACS -> CCS might work but not so conveniently.\n\n> Stop offering vehicles with crap range\n\nThat\'s extremely difficult in fact--extremely difficult to do while maintaining profitability.  For a good enough price/profitability you can\'t put in too much battery. Improving efficiency requires all-in engineering excellence at everything, there are no more easy wins. You need great electronics and high motor efficiency which also means good software, you need lowish mass, you need great aerodynamics.  \n\nMost \'legacy\' manufacturers are failing at that because their efficiency is worse. They aren\'t selling more because they can\'t lower the price and be profitable because their batteries are too big and range is too low.  I think only Hyundai/Kia are competitive with Tesla on efficiency.\n\nThe only remaining easy win which they should be doing is reversing the trend towards excessively large radius non-aero wheels, particularly on their upper models. There should be options for highest range aero wheels and tires on all their models, it improves range substantially. And new EV tires improve efficiency as well. \n\nIt\'s logical then for the existing manufacturers to concentrate on the high-end lines with higher profit margins (e.g. BMW/Porsche) and then wait for their next generation to have both NACS and higher efficiency to compete better with Tesla.

If you regularly tow anything heavy with a truck the Ford lightning isn’t for you, but as a passenger vehicle it looks good, if you don’t mind paying well above the price for a similar ICE F150. The market is filled with uncertainty and the current pricing makes it worse. You need to pay a lot more for a somewhat unknown vehicle where the market is changing and you have no idea what the value will be in 5 years.

The charging network and infrastructure is what will make or break the market. Customers are completely used to the ease and convenience of ICE vehicles when they don't have to think twice about finding a gas station to fill up. And not waste their time sitting for a car to recharge. Give them an EV that has charging stations very sparse and they won't even bother with the EV. Because customers won't downgrade their lifestyle for the sake of new market introductions.\n\nAs you mention the feeling of the Tesla market, this is why they are leaps and bounds ahead of every single EV OEM. They built the charging network first before really refining their vehicles. They've put charging stations in many places where drivers can charge while not using their EVs. The Supercharger helped speed up the charge rates to be comparable to filling a tank of gas. And they continue to expand that network.\n\nWhat has the Legacy OEMs done in this sector? Almost nothing. Their focus is only on the vehicle and they will rely on the charging industry to pick up the pace on infrastructure development. To add, the Legacy OEMs are trying to spit shit out the door just to keep up with the market. And that attempt will fail them every time. Like we see today where they take astounding losses for every EV sale.\n\n>No pressure, no sales push.\n\nThis is more a result of the car dealership business model differences with Tesla. OEM dealer franchises are the cause of this. The franchises are not in the business of producing vehicles. They are a distributor and nothing more. And distributors only make money by pushing sales. So the sale is the #1 priority to the dealer. \n\nWhen you have an OEM retail it becomes a whole different story. Hence why I always feel that the OEMs need to own their own distribution and not let the sales people sit in the driver seat for the business."", "">Car manufacturers don't typically own refuelling stations so it's not in their usual remit to have things like charging stations.\n\nBut manufacturers did at one time invest (or at minimum sponsor) in gas station infrastructures. Because that was the only thing that would spur growth for an ICE vehicle back then. No gas stations, no ICE vehicles. Once the infrastructure was self sustainable they didn't have to invest any longer. \n\nWe're back to the same technology trend from over 100 years ago. EVs are only as reliable as the charging network supporting them. If manufacturers want EVs to grow, they need to dip their foot into the charging network investments. Because if they don't, your ICE vehicle will be back in demand due to the ease of gas stations."", 'I am glad it will hopefully be a lot better in a year or two.\n\nMore EVs on the road is better for all EV owners since more charging stations will pop up the more are driving around.\n\nAlso looking forward for other networks installing NACS connectors that I can easily use without adaptors.', 'Yeah and they are still well above last year for Q3.', 'If no slow down, I guess there was no need for Tesla to drop some vehicles by as much as $40,000 this year alone.

One to alleviate consumption demand as more EVs are in force. And another for the govt to get more taxes from EV drivers.\n\nThe first reason being the peak demand for the grid is going to spike at night when demand is usually at its lowest. Thats going to start increasing kWhr rates to compensate the demand. So 80% of your electricity will be charged at a higher rate because more people charging EVs. General consumers won't like that especially when they don't even have an EV. To compensate, a subpanel for EV charging can be billed at a higher rate while keeping residential power rates at bay.\n\nThe 2nd reason being the govt will (and I guarantee will) lose tax money as more people shift to EVs. They relied on that tax from gas sales. Less gas, less tax revenue. Currently, govts are shifting this by making higher registration fees to compensate. But the annual fees are built on an average basis of driving done per year, per driver, per region. For EVs to get their money's worth, they will need to drive more than the average driver. Govts will always be playing catchup on taxes until its too much and then people just give up on EVs. Govts will need to be able to tax on KWhr usage to at least balance the usage versus cost structure.

That 40% figure simply means that EV was engaged, but doesn't necessarily mean it was solely powering the car. Again, read the engineering documents on Toyota's Synergy drive. You'll find many of your assumptions debunked.\n\nWant more proof? Drain the gas tanks in both vehicles. The Pacifica can accelerate to highway speeds on electric only.

"It is not the EVs, that are lacking in the US, it's the charging which needs to be reliable.","So, I own a ICE vehicle, but often will rent EVs for road trips as road trips are just better in EVs.

Now, many people have questions about the charging and complain about the increased time on road trips with EVs.

The valid complain is the charging, I'm in my 20s and even I need to stop every 3-4 hours.

Charging reliability is where it sucks.

Recently got rented an Ioniq 6. Unable to use Tesla's supercharger network (great advantage on F150 Lightning).

Excellent car, got about 290 miles of range on highway, doing 65/70.

The problem is charging.

- An Electrify America station only had one single 350kW working out of all 4 being 350kW. Two were derated down to 70-80kW because the cables were damaged and had leaked out coolant.

- One EVGo location only had 50kW 'high speed DC fast chargers'. No, they weren't derated, that's the max speed.

- An EA station wouldn't work with the app, wouldn't work with a credit card. We tried 5 times using it, and then used the 150kW next to it. Instead of 15 mins to get to 80% on 350kW we ended up charging for 35 mins.

- Map said a Tesla Supercharger had magic docks and would work for our car. Didn't work. It was a V2 version. Doesn't work for non-Teslas.

----------------------------------------

In most of the country, there are plenty of fast charging options, except for some portions. We do need more charging locations for sure, but not that many more as people imagine.

One thing though - we don't have enough chargers for peak demands during holidays, long weekends, summer etc. More chargers at the locations might be the answer, depending on utility access.

What needs to get better is charging reliability. I have not faith in EVGo and EA to actually improve their reliability once they start the J3400 standard aka the Tesla charger system.

Even with their current chargers they are improving somewhat, but they still suck.

Ultimately, it isn't the lack of charging anymore, it's the reliability of charging that needs to improve.",371,"['We need a lot more L2 AC to reduce the need of urban dc charging.', ""You're kinda the inverse example which highlights charging in a more of a spotlight than it often is. For those who own an EV and charge at home, we spend the vast majority of the time of ownership experiencing vehicular bliss of literally never having to visit a gas station and no maintenance, just waking up to a fully charged vehicle and going about our business. Road trips require better planning for sure and there are some rural routes which are near untravellable. Don't get me wrong, more charging options will be great overall. Simply I've grown way, way beyond the idea that a little inconvenience in the 1-2 road trips a year I take outweigh the extreme benefits."", 'We’re in the “before USB outlets on airplanes” moment of electric cars', 'Chargers should be:\n1. Maintained like gas pumps.\n2. Located in a safe well lit area\n3. Work with no apps, just tap your credit card or walk into the quickie mart and pay cash', 'I have to record this for posterity. ""I own a ICE vehicle, but often will rent EVs for road trips as road trips are just better in EVs"".\n\nYes they are. I\'ve driven in BEVs for several years now, but until recently had never used a Granny Lead. That is, the one that, in countries with 230-250V, you can charge overnight and receive a decent amount of charge. Still, I always thought that they were really there for emergencies. How wrong I was. A Granny Lead makes the inconvenient parts of BEV usage on road trips an absolute doddle. I accept that this works better in Britain and Europe, but let\'s say you set off on a holiday to get to a destination. Somewhere where you\'ll be staying but in the countryside. You have electricity when you get there, but otherwise nothing. No matter. Overnight you\'ll get 70+ miles into the battery. So you can run around the area with not a care.\n\nAnd I run a VW ID3 - the pernickiest brand of BEV you could wish for. If a rapid charger is going to fail it\'ll do it on my car. But generally, they don\'t. That is, in the UK/Europe. Sometimes they do. But 5 minutes later we\'re up and running and I\'m in the cafe next door, getting a coffee.\n\nGoing to say the T-word. Tesla. If you are are at all worried about any kind of charging reliability, get a Tesla. The Super and Destination chargers simply do not go wrong \\[they do, but it\'s really, really, really rare\\] and there are so many of them that there\'s always one around anyway. Even Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford recognised this. That\'s why he signed a deal with Tesla to let Fords use the Supercharger network. Then pretty much everyone else joined like dominoes falling.', ""The non-Tesla charging infrastructure along the route I take to visit family out of state is terrible, though there's a ton of Tesla Superchargers along the way. I have a Tesla Model 3 and no trouble at all charging on the way down and back, but my lease is up in March and I won't be getting another Tesla (because reasons). \n\nUnfortunately, I'm also kind of SOL insofar as getting a CCS-based or even a not-yet-in-existence NACS-based EV because there's very few generic CCS charging stations, and no third-party NACS chargers yet, along the routes I consistently travel (I've looked carefully). While plentiful, the Tesla Supercharger stations are either Gen 1 150KW or Gen 2 250KW, neither of which have Magic Docks, so I don't think any of them will work with non-Tesla vehicles (like a Volvo or a Kia EV) even with a proper NACS adapter -- though correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nAnd the few CCS-based charging stations that do exist along the route I travel have at most 4 stalls, some are 50KW max, and all are frequently ICE'd out or simply non-functional according to PlugShare. I simply cannot risk being stranded with nowhere to charge. There's a Walmart about half-way through my usual trip that has 16 Electrify America stalls, but I can't get to it on a single charge at highway speeds. In my Tesla, I usually stop twice to charge to 80% on the way down and again twice on the way back. At least I can L2 charge when I reach my family's place at the destination.\n\nI will likely sit out this round after I turn in my Model 3 and get a plug-in hybrid instead, where I can at least drive electric around town and charge at home (so, remain electric 85% of the time), and not have to worry about finding appropriate charging stations when I travel long distances from home. \n\nI'll see what the charging ecosystem looks like in another 3-4 years - hopefully better. Though if DJT gets elected, I'm worried that it'll potentially look worse than it does today."", ""I completely agree.  I have rented EVs and the reliability issue with charging stations is the biggest problem.  Also, stations need to be like Tesla with a minimum of 8 units.

EVs themselves are great, but the charging network here in the US sucks.\n\nWe go on road trips every other week and would need a reliable way to charge each time.  That's what makes me hesitant about getting my first EV this fall.  Gotta love the people on here complaining that road trips are a small portion of their experience and they charge at home most of the time.  So then, why are we complaining?  You are correct people.  Charging at home makes EVs great.  It's worrying about doing a road trip that is the problem.

Charging problem with 2015 24kw Japanese import Nissan Leaf,"I've had a 2015 24Kw leaf (Japan import) for \~5 years and have primarily trickle-charges from a standard 10A power-point/wall-socket.

I've plugged it into the leaf today and, although the car beeps and recognises there is a plug in, it does not charge.

Essentially, I am trying to troubleshoot to figure out the problem - did I get the tech specs wrong, is it a fault portable charger etc.

This is [charger](https://ultipower.com.au/collections/portable-ev-charger/products/mida-adjustable-portable-ev-charger-32a-type-1-au-plug). And techspecs I found for my leaf model are [here](https://ev-database.org/car/1019/Nissan-Leaf-24-kWh#charge-table).

From what I could see, using the T1 socket, it should charge upto \~6.6Kw speed. Or at the very least default to like 2.4kw-3.3kw, right? But I'm getting no juice in.

Please understand - Peak charging rate is a poor metric for judging charging speeds! ,"Hello fellow EV enthusiasts,

I wanted to share some insights based on my experience with the 2023 Nissan Ariya, particularly concerning the misconceptions around peak charging rates and actual charging speeds.

I drive a 2023 Nissan Ariya with the larger 87kWh battery pack. While it often gets criticized for its ""low"" peak charging rate of 136kW, the reality is quite different. Thanks to its efficient charging curve, the Ariya actually outperforms many EVs with higher peak charging rates. Here’s why:

# 2023 Nissan Ariya's (87kWh) Real-World Charging Performance

**Peak Charging Rate**: 136kW

**Charging Curve**: Achieves 136kW up to 44% State of Charge (SOC), then gradually tapers off

* By 44% SOC: Maintains 136kW. [(Source)](https://i.redd.it/z9m9mteow0cd1.jpeg)
* By 80% SOC: Falls to 82kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 31 minutes and 44 seconds. ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NissanAriya/comments/1dtcxa1/32_minutes_to_charge_from_9_to_80/#lightbox))

**Average Charging Speed (10% to 80%)**: 107kW.

**Public Perception**: Lackluster charging speeds.

# 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range (82kWh) Real-World Charging Performance

**Peak Charging Rate**: 250kW

**Charging Curve**:

* By 44% SOC: Drops to 121kW.
* By 80% SOC: Falls to 45kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 32 minutes. [(Source)](https://evkx.net/models/tesla/model_3/model_3_long_range/chargingcurve/)

**Average Charging Speed (10% to 80%)**: 97kW.

**Public Perception**: Rarely criticized for charging speeds.

# Polestar 2 (2021-2023) (78kWh) and Volvo XC40/C40 Dual Motor

* **Peak Charging Rate**: 155kW

**Charging Curve**:

* By 44% SOC: Drops to 84kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 36 minutes. [(Source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amWtmGGt8GQ&t=391s)

**Public Perception**: Rarely criticized for charging speeds and seen as a viable alternative to Tesla.

# 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E Long Range RWD (92kWh)

* **Peak Charging Rate**: 150kW

**Charging Curve**:

* By 44% SOC: Drops to 96kW.
* By 80% SOC: Falls to 12kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 44 minutes and 58 seconds. [(Source)](https://evkx.net/models/ford/mustang_mach-e/mustang_mach-e_long_range_rwd/chargingcurve/)

# Conclusion

Peak charging rate is often used as a headline figure to judge an EV's charging capabilities, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. The charging curve and sustained charging speeds are what truly matter in real-world conditions.

The Nissan Ariya, despite its seemingly modest peak rate, delivers excellent overall charging performance, often better than its higher-peak counterparts. When evaluating EVs, it's crucial to look beyond peak numbers and consider how they perform throughout the entire charging session.

I didn't realize how bad it was until I had to do a deep charging session and realized the 55 kw peak isn't the problem, it is that it only holds 55 kw until 50% or so and then you are getting 25-35 kwh.

Similar quotes can be found in literally every EV from someone, and the opposite can as well. \n\nThe EPA cycle changed to be more realistic, so the tesla numbers, which are the EPA numbers, changed. There\'s nothing weird about that.\n\nI\'m defending tesla in the sense that I\'m pointing out they are simply using the EPA numbers just like basically everyone else. That isn\'t exactly tesla specific. The EPA change is universal (not a ""tesla, stop what you\'re doing"" change), primaly having to do with the effect of different drive modes, changing the weighting of the available options (such as regen braking modes and acceleration modes). \n\nThe range estimates are quite accurate, they are under consumption. Having rated range as the base option seems quite logical, as they are more stable and not jumpy causing confusion.', 'Again, that\'s flat out misinformation.\n\nThe EPA cycle gives manufacturers discretion within a certain range of the tested figure.

I\'m not aware of any others needing to reduce their EPA range based on the change, are you?\n\nHere\'s the kicker: that discretion still exists. It\'s why some vehicles vastly outperform their range targets and Tesla vehicles don\'t.\n\nAnd saying rated range is a logical base measurement is pure cope. On the one hand, you have a very accurate range estimate that changes gradually due to aggregate factors that might affect range and is always pretty reliable based on your driving patterns... and on the other you have one that is never going to be realistic outside optimum conditions, drops multiple miles per mile driven BY DESIGN, that then switches to the former system under 50% because they know the ""rated miles"" approach will confuse and strand drivers who think they have more range than they do. That would not make sense to do if the system was ""jumpy and caused anxiety"" as you say, and even if that WAS true, they still apparently think it\'s the best system for not getting stranded.\n\nAlthough, you know what, I admit that I haven\'t extensively tested the sub-50% Tesla guess-o-meter personally. Maybe the disconnect here is that Tesla\'s system is just that terrible. I\'ll defer to your judgement on that, but the ones I\'ve used in other makes are great.\n\nIt is straight up comedy that you could sit here saying Tesla\'s approach is logical from anything other than a marketing and sales standpoint.', 'The EPA cycles does give some leeway, but is nowhere as lenient as you make it out to be. Tesla\'s EPA estimate is still quite accurate and nowhere near as inaccurate and misleading as you make it out to be.\n\nThe confusion with consumption based range reading (outside of clearly labeled once) is that they rather rapidly update unless you have a way to clearly Change the setting, which clutters a display significantly. Should it show for the last 10km? The last 25km? The last 50km? All tie efficiency? None of those options are perfect, and all have major flaws and significant jumps on range rating rather suddenly, but are all affected massively by the environment. Driving up a random small mountain? You suddenly have 75km of range... Except now you\'re at the top and gaming 150km on the way down. It\'s massively affected by the environment. Just using the rated range ignores those. It has its own deficiencies, but so does every other approach. Providing both readily is the best option. \n\n\nSome vehicles outperform EPA in certain conditions - most on city streets and some on highway.\nMost that do so on the highway fit at least some of the criteria I mentioned earlier - big, inefficient tires and inefficient drivetrain. Lucid (the range kings of EVs) perform even worse than tesla\'s on highway tests because they have an even more efficient drivetrain, creating an even greater discrepancy.\n\nTo reiterate, the tesla approach is to have no ""guess-o-meter"". You have the rated range, and you have the consumption and the efficiency based range based on several factors you can look at. Each of those (the rated range and all the different scenarios for efficiency based range) have their uses and have their drawbacks, and acting as though one is inherently superior to all the others is simply stupid. \n\nTLDR: tesla uses EPA range and so does most others. Most don\'t reach EPA range in their least comparatively efficient scenario, since that is the effect of a range test combing several driving scenarios, and those that do are presenting something less than EPA range as EPA range, which doesn\'t make sense / is simply just lying.', ""You've never driven a non-Tesla EV, have you?

When you go up the mountain, the Tesla range estimate drops faster than normal. When you go down the other side, it drops slower. The GM range estimate works the exact same way - except the vehicle is also factoring in temperature and climate control and your previous driving habits to give you a more accurate estimate at any given time than just rated range. The adjustments don't just jump around, they are normalized.\n\nAnd Tesla agrees with me - when their cars get low, they start doing the exact same thing, which you seem to think is too confusing. I guess it must be because they want their drivers to have less useful numbers, right? Gotta make sure they get stranded in their confusion?\n\nI'm having a hard time taking you seriously - the reason it's called a guess-o-meter is because the range is a guess, and that is exactly what Tesla is doing - guessing. They just have it set up so the guess is less accurate above 50%.\n\nAnd on the topic of EPA ranges, I guess all I can say is that it is hilarious how well Tesla has trained its customers.

That is the opposite of guessing, it is presenting several scenarios which the consumer can observe and react to depending on their situation, instead of trying to read the consumers mind, which isn\'t always possible.\n\nAnd yes.

At least for my usage (90+% highway driving at 110) the ""normal driving"" range estimate is pretty much spot on, as the vehicle lifetime efficiency is within a percent of the EPA rated efficiency. You having a differing opinion on this is fine, we simply have a different approach to what we consider the most useful at a glance, and which drawbacks we consider the least impactful. \n\nIn the conversation we have both been basing our standpoint on the same information (aside from you seemingly falsely believing that the range estimation randomly switches modes), and have come to different conclusions of what is best based on said information.

Despite you believing tesla\'s official range reporting is the worst, you never actually came with any arguments or examples of them being worse at matching reported range than most others. Since I can\'t be bothered to look up dozens of examples I\'ll just give two standardised comparative range tests (they actually run the cars at the same time, on the same road), you can look at either Motor1 deutschland\'s testing, where they ran 11 different EVs on the same highway simultaneously.

Which is an interesting way to view the world, that anyone that doesn't think the same way as you do is doing mental gymnastics, rather than acknowledging that people have preferences.\n\nThe EPA range is useful as a tracker for range in normal driving conditions, that is to say, it is useful for seeing how far you will be able to go in a regular charge cycle. It is a consistent tracking method unlike one that also accounts for more factors - for those to be consistent it requires a time frame and a destination. It might be sunny here, but if I'm driving 500km trip then that can rapidly change, changing my range drastically in a moment. Unless there is a navigation route the car isn't aware of this, and the car isn't aware how long you will be driving or at which speeds either, if can't account for those properly, and they all have a significant impact on range. When a navigation route is provided, that changes, and those variables can be accounted for accurately, and in this scenario a tesla will also include that in the calculation for how much energy is needed to drive that distance, and as such the car's current range.\n\nOnce again, we are clearly in disagreement on this subjective topic that sidetracked our conversation from it's original subject.

I said nothing about anyone else.\n\nI haven\'t been talking about preference. Sure, you like one way of doing things that is inherently less accurate by design. You prefer it because you imagine that other systems you haven\'t used are confusing, because you don\'t have experience with them and don\'t know how they work. And you\'re welcome to that preference - it\'s just a worse way of doing it, by any meaningful measure besides your uninformed preference.\n\nYou\'ve done nothing but demonstrate bad faith this whole time. Is it really any wonder that I believe people who show screenshots over you?', ""Except you're continuing to do the exact same thing, you're presenting a false narrative, denying that both approaches have their own flaws, and which you prefer depends the person. If anything, you're the one doing mental gymnastics trying to argue that one approach is inherently better than the other despite that being wholyy untrue, seemingly unable to live with the fact that something isn't inherently and objectively better just because that's what you prefer.\n\nHow am I the one demonstrating bad faith when I am the one bringing actual tests into this and pointing out the subjective nature of the issue, while you're the endlessly repeating the same subjective points that you prefer as objective truths as well as trying to deny and downplay the shortcomings of your preferred method. On top of all this, you're the one that has been vehemently ignoring the actual topic of the conversation and trying to sidetracked it each time it is brought up."", ""Already covered the EPA estimates topic. SAE, Consumer Reports, and screenshotted data from Tesla owners show them failing to meet the efficiency rating, which is backed up by a MY I can check in person.

That's held true in our discussions so far. You claimed that everyone overestimates, which is demonstrably false.\n\nI don't see a need to argue that subject further unless you say something relevant on the topic.\n\nI also said that dynamic range is better, because it is more useful and more likely to be accurate. This is both self-evident (it's the same kind of calculation as how they arrive at EPA range, but tuned to account for more factors) and evident in how accurately it predicts my trips. It also doesn't cause confusion or fluctuate wildly the way you seem to think it does.\n\nYour preference is irrelevant to the point in contention. It's based on uninformed assumptions. Your lack of understanding of how it works is irrelevant to the point in contention. I don't know the algorithm either, just that it works.\n\nYou still haven't demonstrated a use case in which flat rated range is better."", 'You like to say I misinterpret what you say, but flat out lie or misinterpret what I have said yourself. I ahvenot said that all automakers \'overstate\' their taneg, I have that most do as it is the result of how standardised tests work - and have provided properly conducted tests showing that tesla to be one of the more accurate companies at reporting range, unlike you who have provided anecdotes for which we don\'t have proepr insights into the actual testing and no vehicle to compare to. I also provided an example of how the vehicles can differ from test numbers and what causes that difference - that is to say, everything throughout this conversation has pointed to tesla NOT disproportionately overstating range compared to other brands, unlike your original claim.\n\nYou still trying to argue that what you like the most must inherently be the objectively best shows your bias in this conversation, you are blind to the fact that your preferences are not universal truths, and try to refuse the existence of the drawbacks of your prefered method while over exaggerating my critique of it, as I, unlike you it seems, can acknowledge that the different methods have strengths and weaknesses, which each cater to different people.\n\nI have provided several examples of how having a standardised range display can be superior (not inherently being so, but can be), your refusal to acknowledge said examples like an ostrich sticking it\'s head in the ground doesn\'t make them disappear.\n\nYour only real talking points so far have been your personal experience and preferences - ""it\'s evident from accurately it predicts my trips"" are no better than when I have pointed the exact same thing out. You have dismissed when I have pointed out that my lifetime efficiency matches EPA, and that the range display matches daily driving consumption excellently, so why should I not dismiss your claim that the exact same is true for your vehicle? You have no better backing for that claim than I have for mine. And even if we both acknowledge the other\'s word as true (Because I do believe that your range display is accurate as well), both are no more than a single anecdote and so are your examples of two (maybe it maybe not cherry picked accounts) if tesla owners consumption. Except those two are evn less useful, as we don\'t have proper insight into their driving habits or exact situation.\n\nTLDR: I have provided 2 standardised tests showing tesla to be one of the automakers matching their range estimate the best. You have provided two anecdotes of tesla owners not reaching the stated range (like no automaker did in either of the two standardised tests), and neither anectode do we have proper insight into the variables that can have an influence on range.', ""I feel like I must be in the twilight zone.

I have said that I prefer to use a number that is correct in the vast majority of scenarios (99% ish of them time), compared to using a fluctuating number that can be either more or less right depending on the situation. As I have said before, having a range estimate that properly accounts for outside factors requires a navigation route (otherwise the car witn know what speed you\'ll be travelling at, which way the wind is blowing compared to you, what weather it will be during the drive), effects that can have range effect in the double digits of percentage points  - and Tesla does account for that when you have a navigation route.\n\nOnce again, I have the same feeling as you, you seem to be stuck in a very narrow star of mind thinking that your preferences are universal truths, and that all that disagree with you in regards to preferences must be lying to themselves because your opinion is the only right one.

"Anyone driving a BEV with the original battery turning 10, 12, or 14 years soon?","I hear a lot from EV proponents that liquid cooled batteries will outlast the vehicle (maybe that's 20 years from the in-service date).

A friend has a '16 Model S (first owner and he has the lifetime free SCN charging that can be passed on to another Tesla vehicle) and he will be driving it into the ground because Tesla is offering him $15,000 trade-in value.

"From one ev enthusiast to another, can we stop acting like range doesn't matter?","It seems like everytime there is a new ev battery article promising more range, the need for it is often questioned. Citing charging infrastructure as the real concern and that range is fine where its at. An though growing the amount of quality charging stations is definitely important, it's clear that we do need more range when you look at the numbers. First off, the (EPA) range is often lower than the real world miles you can actually get. 

Secondly, weather conditions can significantly impact range. In cold weather, you can lose up to 40% of your range due to the increased energy required for heating the cabin and battery. 

Similarly, hilly terrain can cause rapid battery drain, reducing the car's range even further. Im from West Virginia and I personally know people who own Teslas there and have experienced this issue.

Lastly, millions of people don't have access to home charging, making it difficult for them to own electric cars. Imagine having to take trips to charging stations all the time because you can't charge at home, and your EV's range is equivalent to half a tank of gas. So saying we don't need more range is inconsiderate, just because you have the privilege of charging at home doesn't mean others can. Range anxiety is a real and valid concern for many. Therefore, increasing the range is essential for mitigating the fears around EV's.

But this can be totally wrecked by things like busy V2 superchargers.\n\nYou have to consider the whole system, not just ""spam a bigger battery"". Pack size would be less of an issue of the car was more aero optimized, or the charging curve was better. People tend to focus too much on one factor, like with the new E-GMP cars that have great charging speed and acceptable battery sizes, but they are like driving a barn when doing more than 80mph so lose any travel time advantage. Getting a newer S would help somewhat with its improved curve, but I can already come within 5-10% of the EV cannonball average speed routinely.

But with current tech you\'ll need a fairly high end EV to make that not a nightmare. \n\nThen there\'s the charging. The more EVs can be handled like ICE for getting energy into them, the better. There\'s \\_a lot\\_ of people here that do not have access to residential charging. DCFC + big batteries make owners independent of infrastructure. \n\nIt\'s really not only ""fears"".

Where in your ICE these variations are minimal with MPG.\n\nThat's why we love our X5 PHEV, awesome around town and then when we hit 68mph, it switches to ICE seamlessly and we get the best MPG possible.

It matters a lot.  \n\nParity, or even approximate parity with ICE cars for road trips is my benchmark.  My ICE car for family road trips is a big, low mpg SUV (2007 Sequoia V8).  On a road trip it can go about 300-350mi on a full tank, and we can go from 100% full, to about 10% full with no anxiety because gas stations exist every 20 or fewer miles almost everywhere.  So we can go about 300 miles between stops, and it takes 5 minutes to fill up to 100% full.  \n\nWhen my family takes long road trips, we take as few stops as possible and make them as brief as possible.  15min TOPS, often under 10min.\n\nTesla Supercharger network is the only charging network currently that comes close at all to the density of gas stations, and even then it\'s still a long ways off.  So you can\'t just drive anywhere you please, and you can\'t always go to 10% or lower range because you have to stop when there\'s a charging station, since the next one might be 100mi away.\n\nTo get 300mi of usable range on a road trip, you need a Lithium battery that has at LEAST 375mi EPA range, because you can\'t plan to always go below 10%, and you don\'t want to charge over 90% because it takes SOOOO long.  So 80% of 375 gives your 300mi usable range.  But an 80% charge takes nearly an hour, even with the fastest chargers and newest high voltage batteries.  So that\'s really not getting you parity with that 5min fill up worth 300mi of range.  \n\nTo get parity with that fillup time + range of the ICE car, you need a 500mi or more battery.  With 500mi of EPA range you will be able to add about 300mi of driving range in about 20-30 minutes depending on conditions and SOC at start of charging.  To go from 10%-70% (300mi of a 500mi range battery) should be possible in around 20min for new batteries charging at high voltages.  A 250kW Supercharger adds about 1000 mi of range per hour for the first 20% of charging  (e.g. from 10% to 30%) or so, but drops after that.\n\nAgain all of this is prefaced with the assumption that we\'re with Lithium battery tech for the foreseeable future.  Solid state tech is coming, but won\'t be in cars for several years yet, most likely.  \n\nSo for now, for long road trips, range really makes a difference, if you\'re comparing to ICE total travel time.\n\nMany people will respond with ""I can\'t imagine driving more than 200mi without stopping and when I do I/we need to stretch our legs and poop for at least 30 minutes.""  We hear you and that\'s nice.  For the rest of us who don\'t enjoy the Harris Ranch supercharger as a tourist destination, and would like to get back on the road ASAP, more range would be nice.\n\nIf you do like to stop every 200 miles or so, well then you would be even closer to parity with a gasoline fill-up time.  Adding 200mi of range to a 500mi battery would take about 12minutes.  That\'s pretty quick.  Hard to go pee and buy a snickers faster than that.\n\nTL/DR: for Lithium batteries, longer EPA ""range"" really equates to faster/less charging time for long road trips.', '95% of my drives are less than 60 miles round trip.

It costs more up front. The battery is the most expensive component in an EV. It is also heavy. For every km you add to your range, you are putting out hard earned cash, and reducing performance and interior space. It takes longer to charge, to the point that a standard 240v circuit may take more than 12 hours to recharge a depleted battery.

Plus, I only have one kids, he\'s 16, has his own wheels (well, my wife\'s wheels technically), so I don\'t have to lug him/his stuff around. The farthest family from us is about 180 miles away, no mountains between us (Michigan is pretty flat), they have a garage with 110 outlets and there\'s a Supercharger en-route so, zero range concerns there.

But as development increases and regional centres develop, it\'s likely range will decrease on average as a requirement rather than increase, particularly as hybrid work patterns become standardised to some extent, in some industries (commute *time* will likely increase due to traffic).\n\ntl;dr: It still comes down to utility, and cheaper batteries don\'t make people drive exponentially longer distances. Predicting that range will increase because computer memory did, and that range has no upper limit on utility is easily disproven simply by looking at the car industry over the last 100 years and average commute times.

This is basically the same drivetrain as the Prius that has been kicking around with for the last 15+ years, just sized up to handle more torque.  \n\n\nBattery is an 18kWH pack. I think it weighs like 300-400 pounds, so it's not much heavier than a big passenger or two. Hybrid mode gas mileage is around 38 mpg vs the R4Hybrid's 40 mpg, so the added weight doesn't suck much extra gas. Of course, it lets you drive in EV mode for most if not all of my day, so it saves a lot of gas over a hybrid for my use case.

Or if you needed to do one big 300-400 mile day, you could do it nonstop.

ChargePoint level 2 home charger software problem days after warranty expired.,"I purchased a Bolt EUV in November 2022.

They *really* to make non-Tesla charging easier for your average customer. Spent 15 minutes with 3 different groups today at Electrify America in the Seattle area teaching them how to charge.,"I drove up to charge my ioniq 5, no issues. But I saw the older couple next to me struggling to figure out how to charge their new Audi e-tron. So I went over to ask how things were going and they said they had just bought the car and were trying to figure out how to charge. I showed them how to plug in, use their credit card on the reader, and then charge. Apparently Audi doesn’t have a 2 years for free plan or they weren’t aware of it when I asked. They thanked me profusely and went on to go shop at Target. 

Immediately after, a woman in a shiny new Nissan Leaf drives up to the space next to mine and tries to plug in the CCS charger. I say hi and tell her that her car needed a special plug called CHAdeMO and pointed her to the open blue one at the other station. She thanks me and moves her car over and plugs in successfully.

So I go on my own merry way into target while my car is charging to 80%. In the store, I tried to check the charging status on the EA app but it says that charging has stopped at only 76%. Weird but not the end of the world.

I go outside and as I’m walking back to the station I immediately see the problem: someone had parked next to me where there was a non functioning station and now they were trying to plug the 2nd charger on my station into their car, a Chevy Bolt.

I say hi and say “ah so this is why my car stopped charging” and point to the 2nd charger in their hand. I tell them that each station has two chargers but can only charge with 1 at a time and that they had accidentally ended my session. They apologized and I told them it was all right. They were from out of town and had just rented the Chevy bolt so they were unfamiliar with how it all worked.

I told them they could charge on my station as I was pretty good at 76%. I backed out and let them take it and was on my own merry way.

Unless vehicles that can actually USE 3phase come to NA, I find it unlikely that most sites would install 3phase wiring.  And to be honest, given the extra size/weight/cost of a 3phase AC-DC converter, and the lack of 3phase wiring in residential homes, I don't see this happening on passenger cars more or less ever.  \nMore likely they'd just take the 480v 3ph input, and split it out so each port gets 1x 277v phase hot, neutral, and ground.  That's saving two conductors and two breakers for each stall.  Or wire a few of them in a MWBC configuration (so one 3phase breaker feeds several stalls with a beefy shared neutral).  \n\nThat all said- there is one place where you might have a point- commercial vehicles.  I'm thinking delivery trucks, 8-12' box trucks.  Those are ripe for electrification, but they're on the road more or less all day and would need a pretty beefy battery.  Single phase will get you 13.3kW (277v 48a), which in 8 hours transfers about 106.4 kWh.  In theory the truck would be parked for 12hr or more (few operations run 16hrs/day) but I could see a few situations where more juice is desirable.  Bumping that up to 3 phase gives you MUCH more energy transfer.  \n\nThat could also be useful for a delivery truck that makes many small stops, and comes back to reload.  Such a truck could go beyond its range in a day if it comes back and recharges while reloading, and the faster it can recharge the better.  \nOf course you could argue that the 3phase AC-DC converter is better placed offboard in a DCFC charger..."", ""It looks like they're unifying J1772, J3068, J3400 in the sense that they can all now (mechanically speaking) plug into the same public EVSE receptacle."", 'Look carefully at how the article is formatted.

I read that too quickly.', ""That's certainly possible.  And I suppose there's some wisdom in allowing it in the spec, or at least not making decisions today that inhibit it in the future.  \n\nI think the flip side of the coin is a high output charger that takes 3phase 480v input and produces high wattage DC output (say, 20+kW) has a cost and weight to it.  So it'd be more efficient to just build a lot of smaller ones (say, 20-50kW output), make them cheap through scale, and put them on the warehouse where the truck parks to reload.  Because if you have 50 trucks, 25 warehouse bays, and the trucks are constantly going out for deliveries and coming back to reload, it makes sense to pay for 25 fast charge units on the warehouse than 50 equivalent fast charge circuits mounting one in each truck.  \n\nOTOH, if you have 100 trucks, 25 bays, but only 10 of your trucks are electric, then putting DCFC units at each bay is unnecessarily costly.  It's easier to put the charger in the truck and a simple 3phase output port on each bay, than to run your logistics to ensure an electric truck is always at an electric bay (which may not well suit your delivery schedule or warehouse layout).  \n\nAnother possibility is long haul trucks (think 18 wheelers, Tesla Semi, etc).  There's much talk of megawatt-class chargers refueling these things.  But those won't be cheap.  It'd be MUCH easier to get a Pilot or Flying J type station to run a 3 phase power feed to some part of the lot and set up a few 3 phase EVSEs (few tens of thousands of dollars in most cases, most of it for digging up the lot and running the wire) than set up multiple megawatt-class DCFC units (hundreds of thousands of dollars, probably more).  If the truck needs to get back on the road fast then yeah you need a megawatt-class DCFC.  If the driver is staying overnight, then 480v 3phase will do it, and the J3068 spec apparently allows up to 160A at 480v or 600v 3 phase, which is enough to charge even a large semi overnight.  \nAnd while, from an overall efficiency perspective, it's more efficient to put a larger AC-DC converter in the infrastructure rather than a truck (just as trucks don't have their own diesel pumps to suck fuel out of the ground, it's more efficient to put the pump at the station), there may well be a transition period where a large truck can take 50+kW AC.  \n\nSo yeah I guess this makes sense when you get out of the passenger vehicle realm and think bigger-- one dispenser port that can handle anything from a Smart Car to a semi (just with different cables)."", 'With how big a Combo connector is, it’s silly that it only does 1P charging.

Odd problem with L2 EV Charging... Help!,"Precursor: I do have an electrician coming back out in 2 weeks, just looking to see if anyone else has this problem.

My wife finally decided on her next lease, Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe, to jump into the water of EV cars and to see if they could work for us. It came with a wall charger. Been using that, but on random occasions once every other charge cycle, it blows the GFCI. Electrician said its common, usually because it gets too hot, but not a big deal because the GFCI is doing its job. Also not such a big deal as I ordered a Level 2 unit to go into the 240 outlet on the other wall. 

Got the Juicebox level 2 40amp charger installed last night. 220/240v NEMA 14-50 plug, on a 50 amp circuit. Installs and sets up perfectly. 

All is well and good, plug it in to charge, come into the house, and after a few minutes, notice that the motion activated light switches in the laundry room and pantry...are constantly triggering while the car is plugged in and charging.

So the user experience was effectively identical to our current charging infrastructure.', 'My battery pack supposedly weighs 1700lbs so I ain’t too worried about theft.

Charge complete and those lazy fucks don't think to move the car forward 50 feet to a free spot. I was thinking the Tesla spots are just in better spots where you are but if the spots are limited I'm not surprised that happens.\n\nIt'd be nice to see some design/infrastructure changes for superchargers... like maybe a pass through style, cars in the queue park behind and spots in front are left open for finished charges. It'd be great in the future if charging could somehow auto disconnect and then the summon feature would move the car forward. We are many years away from that, but logical design could get rid of these headaches.\n\nThere's Teslas out here but definitely not as many as in California - I am yet to get to a charging location with no spots available."", ""You're certainly not wrong.

Dangerous Disconnect: Tesla Home Charging Problem Analyzed And Corrected,,10,"['I\'ve had work done by 5 different ""electricians."" Guess how many torque wrenches/screwdrivers I\'ve seen.\n\n\nIm guessing every connection wasn\'t torqued enough.\xa0', 'They mention everything is up to code, but I’m guessing that aluminum run was #6 and not #4 which wouldn’t be to code and would explain the melting at both ends — main panel and the non bladed disconnect.', 'I watched it earlier.. my question is Tom thinks the metal is going when you over torque it? He says the wire is crushed and the area shrinks. That’s not how metal works.', 'TLDR: NOTHING was torqued, and I suspect an alien breaker (incompatible type) in that main panel. And, like Alec says, the Fastest Charge Possible (tm) [""may bring more headaches than you bargained for""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iyp_X3mwE1w&t=1695s).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTop of my mind is 3 separate burn-ups and it **never occurs to this guy to reduce charge amps?**  Thermal rise is the square of amps, so a little amp reduction results in a big heat reduction.\n\nThis wasn\'t asked, but I also wonder if the guy did Gas Station Mode where you refill in a long all-night charge at max power, which creates a thermal worst-case.  Heavy copper takes awhile to get hot; 45 minute nightly sessions might\'ve been OK. \n\nBut let\'s run through the faults.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The main panel bus stab burn-up** is usually from using an ""alien breaker"" - a type not UL-listed for that panel.  (the panel label lists all permitted types).  That happens when a subsequent contractor comes along and goes ""Well I\'ll stick in the breaker I have on the truck, they\'re all the same"".  Breaker types listed on the panel labeling are no joke; they\'re not actually compatible.\n\nIt\'s not an anti-competition thing.  In the USA, breaker competition is protected by UL\'s being willing to certify (""UL-Classify"") brand X breakers for brand Y panels. E.G. Eaton CL is certified for Siemens and GE and HOMeline panels.  However, Eaton BR is NOT certified for those panels, even though it seems to fit, because it will melt bus stabs if you do.\n\nWhat to do about the burnt up bus stabs? You could just not use those spaces, but there\'s an easy answer:  It\'s a 2-year old panel, ***it\'s still in the catalog***, buy another panel of that exact same model.  The **interior** (word for everything that is not the breakers, wires, box or cover) simply unscrews with 2-3 screws, swap interiors and Bob\'s your uncle.  Their other option was a panel replacement; all that means is swapping the box also.  It\'s just a metal box, there is ZERO benefit to doing that, hours of pure labor to no useful use except to run up the invoice...  but proposing that is where QMerit\'s electricians show their true colors.\n\nNobody joins QMerit to do Chevy Bolt standard installs.  It\'s all about the upsell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for **the main-subpanel feeder** (seen briefly at 11:25; the subpanel was gutted after the meltdown).  We ""need to talk"" about aluminum wire.  Large aluminum feeder has 70 years of proven reliability when rules  are followed: **a) screw torques must be correct** which is no different from copper, by the way.   Their array of problems proves nothing was torqued, ever.  And **b) terminals must be certified for aluminum**, but that\'s not a problem for a main- to sub-panel feeder since lugs at both ends are aluminum rated and in fact *made of* aluminum.   Aluminum lugs work because thermal expansion differences work favorably when aluminum is the lug wrapping around the copper; the trouble is the reverse, which is what went wrong with a foolish effort to use aluminum for small 15-20A branch circuits in the 1960s-70s.  The receptacles still had brass terminals and nobody was using torque screwdrivers on the small stuff back then.\n\nMeanwhile, for the past 70 years, aluminum heavy feeders have proven reliable due to AL-rated panel lugs and electricians using torque wrenches on the big stuff.\n\nSo what went wrong with the subpanel feeder?  On the main panel end, it was an alien breaker or not torqued properly.  On the subpanel end, same possibilities.   Now that was a terrible fix on that subpanel; that sub was less than 2 years old so it\'s still made, the right answer was to go buy the exact same panel and swap in interiors, and correct the torquing / alien breaker problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext up: **the wiring from subpanel to disconnect**.  That was 6/3 Romex, which is 55A wire per NEC 334.80 and Table 310.16.  Its continuous max is 44A, and they pulled 48A because *Fastest Charge Possible (tm)*.  Running wires at thermal limits reveals the slightest flaws in the work, and they were running beyond thermal limits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext: **the pullout disconnect**.   TLDR: Nothing was torqued. But they are CHEAP.  I wouldn\'t be surprised if a pullout disconnect melted after 6 hours of 48A even if it is in fact rated for 60A.  They were never imagined for that service.  Indeed, damage was more uniform than I expected - usually you see one wire completely wrecked with much diminished damage on adjacent wires, but the damage even splashed over to the other side, which has little thermal conductivity to it. This suggests to me all terminals were running hotter than they should.  It wouldn\'t even surprise me if this was a 30A disconnect.\n\nBut regardless, pullout disconnects are cheap trash, and should be derated 50% in EV service (60A disconnect derate to 30A breaker/24A charge).  Most installations do not require a disconnect because of 625.43, but if you do need one, use a well-built knife switch style.  The difference is obvious.  And never accept anything in a plastic enclosure.\n\nBy the way, an important difference with A/C units vs EVSEs is that A/C units have thermal and overload protection on the motor itself.  EVSEs don\'t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, the whip from disconnect to EVSE.  Nothing I can see wrong with it, looks like #6 wire inside FMC conduit. Not elegant but it didn\'t fail lol.\n\nReplacing the EVSE was gross overkill, but whatever. Heat will run down copper wires, but I\'ve never seen thermal damage go anywhere near 2 feet', ""Qmerit is just a referral program.\xa0 There's some real horror stories about some of their electricians as well.\xa0\n\nEdit:Okay, it's primarily a referral program."", ""I'm not where I can view the video, but that also looks like a cheapie pullout disconnect. They,re pretty flimsy IMO. \n\nI would expect in an overload condition where they're getting the terminals very hot, the plastic would just melt, and pulling out the pullout would just cause the metal bars to detach and stay in contact, leaving you unable to remove power."", ""I think the electrician said that all the wire connecting into the disconnect was copper.  Maybe number six Romex which wouldn't be to code, but that's not why the disconnect melted: some combination of the cheap pull out type, and a lack of adequate measure torque on the terminals.\n\nIt seems that the aluminum wire was just the feeder to the subpanel, which should be a fine use of aluminum wire. I wish they had more details on what that setup was and what the problems were."", ""It can squish out, along the direction of the wire if it's not able to squish it to the sides.\n\nHere's a video with a demonstration that increasing torque doesn't always make things better, and then a discussion (but not a demo), starting around 5:55, up the phenomenon that Tom mentions.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EB-Zh89nHnk\n\nCopper is a very malleable metal, and copper wire is annealed to be soft.  But it also work hardens.  A simple way to demonstrate that is to take a little scrap of copper wire and hammer it into flat foil.  The foil you get from that will be stiff and brittle, very different from annealed copper foil that you buy.  If you heat it with a torch, you can anneal it, and get it back to you the same soft state as copper foil that you buy."", 'Excellent analysis.  Next time Tom should call you to do a site visit with him.', ""Yes they are a referral program. Yes there are some real horror stories about electricians affiliated with them. But they do also have training and quality standards.  And they are somebody to turn to to complain if you have a problem.  I'm not convinced that that makes it worthwhile to go through them, but I don't think it's accurate to say that they are just a referral program."", 'Yes, it\'s a cheapy pull-out disconnect.  Yes, the plastic melted.  I think that if they had pulled it out while the plastic was soft and drippy, it would not have disconnected, but it looked like they pulled it out after it had been turned off for a while and the plastic hardened again and the pull-out was successful. \n\nThey rewired it with no disconnect, but recommended that if you do use a disconnect, to use what they called a ""scissors type"" disconnect, by which they meant a regular one with a metal lever on the side.  I don\'t think I\'ve heard that called scissors type before--have you?', 'Agreed. They spliced at the old sub panel so I guess we won’t know. I could see what you’re saying though.

It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest to find that one side of that 40 amp breaker has tripped, and so your charger is only getting 120V instead of the expected 240V.  This would cut the charging speed in half, but not the current (which would stay at 32A).\n\nRemember that the EVSE tells the vehicle how much current to draw.  It's not the other way around.  The J1772 standard does not have a setting for 16 amps on an L2 EVSE.  So I don't think it's even _possible_ for your EVSE to tell the vehicle to only draw 16 amps.  However, it's quite likely that your EVSE is telling the vehicle to draw 32 amps, but because one leg is dead, the vehicle is only getting half the requested power.

Problem with the Cyber and Semi-Truck charging model;,"Hello EV enthusiasts and those watching the roll out of the Cyber and Semi truck.  

&#x200B;

Mechanical engineer here about a project/investigation I worked on.

I had a truck stop owner's group ask me about the charging requirements for the cyber and the semi-truck.  I requested the data from the right sources and researched as best I can about the charger capabilities, range and charging times and primary electrical infrastructure costs, electrical costs.

&#x200B;

Here's the problem:

The electrical demand costs from the utility do not match the charging frequency demand of the trucks.  It's simple numbers and overhead costs, with the amount of electrical vs number of charges.  If the chargers are installed, and someone charges a cyber or semi, the rate payer (whomever that is supposed to be in this model) gets stuck with the demand charges that now reoccur every month.  

At 1000 kW, that Pacific Power CA utility demand fee would be $15,500 PER MONTH, at a minimum.  Even if just one (1) truck charges at this high level 3 charging, that power demand is set for the next 11 months.  Certain electrical utilities are certainly different but ratcheting/revolving demand fees are common.  You have to pay for at least a portion if not all of the demand every month whether you use it or not.  

Tesla has hit a wall here with this roll out.  

Who is supposed to absorb the demand charge?  

How would anyone be on board being responsible for this electrical responsibility/liability?

And hope and pray that a Tesla semi or cyber comes rolling by for a charge?

You would have to have semi and cyber trucks lined up for hours and charge them one at a time for this to make any financial sense.  

How could you (or a truck stop) possibly set charging fee rates on this model?  There's no way that's possible.  You think truck stops are going to speculate revenue?  At these prices of power usage?  No way.   But they absorb the demand fees internally as well.  The financials on that model don't look very good at all.  

Thoughts?  

&#x200B;

I don't see how a roll out is possible, other than people like Frito-Lay and Pepsi who charge inhouse, avoid paying retail power rates. ",2,"[""This is a struggle across the industry, not just for that utility. Demand charges are real and they definitely hinder charging deployment. The only way for it to make financial sense is to assume a baseline utilization load, which is why you don't see DC fast charging in the middle of the woods..\n\nThere are strategies that are used to limit demand charges on the grid, like on site battery storage, but that also increases initial capital expenses. \n\nGood news is that the site will not likely hit that high of a peak demand for a while. Your charging management system can also impose site limits to prevent from exceeding a certain threshold. \n\n*I'm a charging infrastructure engineer specializing in medium and heavy duty fleets"", ""Demand charges are definitely an issue with high power DC fast charging.  The problem is particularly acute for low volume stations that happen to get a couple coincident loads during a billing period. \n\nThe question for your analysis becomes, what kind of traffic/volume  were you assuming?  \n\nThere's also a pretty stark difference between a Cybertruck and the Semi, both in charge rate and capacity.  In general, the large battery sizes and relatively low efficiency of these vehicles will help station owners sell the volume of energy needed to recover the demand charge + energy fee.""]",https://www.reddit.com/r/evcharging/comments/18qw7q7/problem_with_the_cyber_and_semitruck_charging/

Designs that weren't really intended to work with ground fault breakers often send enough current through that it can trip a ground fault breaker.

However, they can also lead to nuisance tripping when used in conjunction with a Level-2 charger that will shut down the associated circuit and halt charging on your vehicle. This will cause headaches for homeowners who will have to continually reset the tripped breakers.\n\nNEMA plugs are also subject to wear and tear with the continual plugging and unplugging of the units. So, in addition to the nuisance breaker trips, the plug life cycle will also be a challenge.\n\nShould You Hardwire Your EV Charger or Use a NEMA 14-50 Outlet?\n\nHardwiring your EV charger is a more permanent solution. It requires a dedicated circuit, which can be a more reliable method to charge your vehicle. A hardwired EV charger has built-in GFCI protection, but it does come with an automatic reset as long as there is no issue that is causing the GFCI to trip. GFCI protection is an important component to keeping people safe."", 'Why ask the question if you won’t listen to the answer. \n\nThe charger you have is fighting with the GFCI breaker.

PSA: Inspect your charger receptacles regularly!!!," My plug receptacle and charger was originally purchased and installed in 2016. Saw some recent posts about overheating or melting Leviton outlets not keeping up with the duty cycle involved with EV charging which prompted me to check ours. Indeed, we had a leviton plug and it had gotten too hot. There was some mild deformation and melted plastic surface on the front and white powdery oxidation on the back indicating it was overheating
 I'm glad we noticed before it caused a fire or damaged the charger. There were no symptoms or indicators of a problem. I was charging at 9.6kw. The charger plug on my juicebox 40 remains undamaged, so now l've upgraded to a heavy-duty EV specific receptacle. Also, I recommend verifying the connections at the breaker box for your main panel, as well as the plug itself. Ours had loosened over the years.",51,"['Better….. Hardwire', 'Always a good reminder.

If it's Leviton and doesn't have the EV logo on it, it's a hazard and should be addressed as soon as it's practical.   Leviton has updated their instructions and says not to use it for EV charging.\n\n* After it's been running for a few hours, feel the temperature. If it's more than a little warm, there could be a problem.\n\n* Measure the diameter.  If it's closer to 2-1/8 than 2.5, it's a relatively light duty model and you should at least check the temperature regularly, and should consider upgrading. \n\nThe best upgrade is to !hardwire.  If you continue to use a !receptacle, get one of the high quality ones listed in the reply to this comment.  The EV rated Leviton that OP got is fine with 6 gauge wire but you can do better for less money with the Bryant 9450.  And if you have a 50 amp circuit with 8 gauge wire, the EV rated Leviton is not allowed by code because it's temperature rating isn't high enough. \n\nFor tightening terminals including the breaker, the first time it's tightened, you can use any kind of torque screwdriver or torque wrench that is accurate in the range of the specified torque, which you can find in the instructions or marked on the breaker itself, although that's often on a label on the side so it's not really accessible so you probably do want to look it up online.  For retightening, best practice is go up to 90% of the rated torque and if it doesn't budge, it's better to leave it than to disturb it.  For that, it's better to use a beam style torque wrench that shows you the value that you are applying rather than a click type.  And the beam style ones are great for DIY use because they never need calibration and are highly accurate even though they are inexpensive.  A quarter inch drive beam style is usually a good range for the types of terminals you'll encounter in EV charging."", 'Someone referenced and ac running constantly.

Is anyone else’s NeoCharge secondary port acting up all of a sudden?,"Hello all -

Came home today and whenever I plug my EV in, the internal switcher on the NeoCharge seems to cut power to it. I tried factory resetting and such, no dice.

Strange part: plugging my EV Charger into the “Primary” side seems to work. The car charges without problems. Seems to just be the secondary side…

I remember getting an email about a new firmware, so I’m not sure if this may have played a hand? Just curious if anyone else is experiencing this issue…

Thanks!

——————————————————————————————

**EDIT:** For all the newcomers to this post: firmware v1973 fixed this issue for me and others in the thread. This new firmware should install automatically when your splitter isn’t in use as long as you’re connected to WiFi. It doesn’t hurt to factory reset to force the update along - I did this myself.

Ironically enough, I’m now getting push notifications and consistent updates on the splitter’s activity in-app, and I wasn’t before… so I’d say it’s working better than before somehow.

Although this sucked, luckily the problem wasn’t present for too long and it is now solved I hope.

From what you’ve described, it seems like the issue might relate to the firmware or the setup with your circuit. To get started, let’s try a few troubleshooting steps:\n\n**Factory Reset:** Try factory resetting your Smart Splitter by turning your circuit breaker off/on 5 times. Wait for 3 seconds between each flip. Once the Smart Splitter displays blinking blue indicators, it has successfully reset and entered Bluetooth pairing mode.\n\n**Reconnect to WiFi:** Use the NeoCharge App to reconnect the Smart Splitter to WiFi. This ensures that the latest firmware is automatically updated to your device.\n\n**Run on Secondary Side Alone:** Test running the device plugged into the secondary side of your Smart Splitter without power from the primary side and see if the issue persists.\n\nIf you’ve already completed these steps and the issue continues, it might be a bug that needs further investigation from our development team. I’ll escalate your case to them, and they’ll do their best to provide further assistance.\n\nThanks for your patience, and please let me know if there’s anything else I can help with.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThis response was created by AI”', 'Looks like they pushed an update over the air right away so if you are connected to WiFi this should all be fixed now.

My electrical panel and breaker burned. Not sure why. Maybe electrician used the wrong breakers?,"fter having the wiring and a 60amp breaker installed to my garage, a licensed electrician installed the Emporia EVSE/charger.

I barely used it because I have free charging at Electrify America for 2 years. But I used it maybe once a month or once every two months.

But one day, I noticed that the charging session stopped and when I went to the charger in my garage, it was beeping and the app gave me a ""leakage fault detection"" error.

So I went to reset it by turning off the breaker and back on. But I noticed that the breaker did not ""click"" when I tried to reset it. I was also very concerned that when I switched off the breaker, the Emporia EVSE still had power!

So I immediately called my electrician and he came over and found that the breaker had burned/melted severely (see attached photos) and damaged the bus in our electrical panel and even burned the 20amp breaker below the 60amp breaker!

It has been suggested that the electrician who installed it used the wrong breaker and that was the cause of the melting/fire. Most of the breakers in my panel are Siemens, but he used an Eaton BR series breaker which is not a good idea. You are not supposed to mix brands of breakers. My electrician disagreed and sent me a screenshot that shows that Eaton breakers are compatible with Siemens, but that info was for Eaton CL series breakers which are different than Eaton BR series breakers apparently.  
(Please note, all this information is from Reddit, so take that with a grain of salt.)  
  
Another electrician then put a new 50amp Siemens breaker down below further down the bus and reconnected the Emporia EVSE.

After that, I was able to charge my car once, but started getting ""Leakage Detection Fault"" errors when the charging would start. Then I started getting the error and beeping immediately after turning on the breaker. So I knew something was still wrong even when charging at only 16 amps.

We thought it was an issue with the wiring and tried to troubleshoot that, but could find nothing wrong with the wiring.

So I contacted Emporia and thankfully sent a new charger out right away.

I had the new one installed and since then, I have not had any problems charging my cars or any more ""Leakage Detection Fault"" errors.

I did notice that the newer version of the Emporia charger does have a revised circuit board, additional fuses on the board and larger components. Maybe the newer revisions of the circuit board are more reliable?  
(Sorry I did not take pictures of either the new or old circuit board...)

So, it's pretty clear that it was a defective Emporia EVSE charger too. Could it be related to the problems with the melting breaker? I have been told that that's not possible.

But now I have to spend $4000 or more replacing my entire electrical panel since the bus and panel were damaged in the fire. It's expensive when you include parts, labor and city permits.

But I just wanted to warn anyone about mixing breaker types and it is possible to have a faulty EVSE.",21,"[""The faulty EVSE was just a coincidence and was not the root cause. Like I said in the other post, you had an incompetent electrician who installed an Eaton BR breaker into a Siemens QP panel.\n\nGo after his insurance and bond for the cost of the panel replacement. It's possible your home insurance company could do this for you."", 'Damn I’m sorry you had to go through that BS. It seems like everything has to be double checked by a homeowner these days. Earlier today someone posted about their electrician installing a 14-50 outlet with 3 wires instead of 4. So much sloppy work out there. Good luck with your panel replacement.', 'One reason I always repeat Technology Connections\' ""you don\'t need a 50A circuit"" advice https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Iyp_X3mwE1w&t=1695s … is that EV charging current is no joke.  It runs the equipment at continuous thermal limits for many hours, literally the worst possible thermal situation.  Any flaw in the work WILL be found and made crispy.   \n\nA lot of non-electricians and some electricians want to believe all 1” form factor breakers are equal, identical and/or interchangeable.   It\'s easier to slap in whatever breaker they have in the truck and not have to have 4 kinds.  The most foolhardy of them say it directly in the face of the irrefutable evidence to the contrary.  And yours is the worst case I have seen.   How can anyone say a BR is compatible with a Siemens bus after this? \n\nSo I see 3 potential flaws here: \n\nFirst, The breaker failing so spectacularly that it entirely melted the bus clip assembly clean off the breaker, says it was series arcing on BOTH terminals.  What would cause that?  Unless the bus stab was already damaged when the breaker was initially installed, the only thing that explains that level of destruction on the bus clips is they are incompatible with the bus stabs.  \n\nAs brycenesbitt says, the easiest fix here (""easy"" being relative) is to find an identical panel of the same generation, and swap interiors.  The interior is everything that isn\'t wires, cover, or box. It\'s that huge assembly on a piece of gray plastic.   Swapping interior on an all-in-one is challenging and will require ""pulling the meter"".  Don\'t believe or hire anyone who says it can be done ""hot"".  \n\nSecond, science has revealed that screw torque really matters, even on the small stuff.  This is another fact many find ""inconvenient"", though also insulted that the work they\'ve been doing for 20 years is all wrong.  (Yes it was; the torque driver requirement didn\'t suddenly appear in NEC 2017 at 110.14(D), it was in UL approved instructions and 110.3(B) this whole time.  Really).   But some brag that they keep a torque screwdriver in shrink wrap on the truck in case the inspector ever asks.  And inspectors choose their fights.   The electrician bears liability for failures not the inspector.  \n\nSo this may explain the failure of the Wallbox. \n\nThird, it is a common error to use 6/2 or 6/3 Romex or UF for a 60A circuit that charges at 48A.  That\'s not allowed. Read 240.4(B) carefully.   Given that the next electrician went 50A breaker, I wonder if this was one of those.  \n\nFourth, that\'s an all-in-one panel, and I have a hunch it is a 100A or 125A panel, which would call the service load calculation into question.', ""It's pretty clear that the original problem was caused by mismatched breaker type/panel.  The puzzle is whether there's some way that damaged the Emporia, or whether the Emporia failure is just a coincidence.\n\nAnother question is whether to go after the electrician who illegally installed the mismatched breakers to get them to pay for at least part of the new panel\n\nAn option is sometimes to replace the bus bars in the old panel.  That saves parts cost (minor cost of the steel box), but also saves labor, since you can leave all (or at least most) of the wires on the breakers, as well as ground and neutral wires, and quickly pop the breakers off and back on after attaching the new bus bars.    I don't new if a replacement kit is available for yours."", ""What's the exact brand and model # of the panel?"", 'This is kind of wild. I’m no electrician and did this install without issue and I’ve been using my charger daily for two months now. I did ask a bunch of questions and when I went to buy the breaker, the supply house told me it had to match my existing panel. Had it not been for that, I would have bought any old breaker.', ""First, this should be claim against the sparky.  \nSecond, this could be a claim for your HO insurance.  \nThird, the economical way to do this is buy the exact same panel as you have now, and do some parts swaps in place.  What type of panel is this?\n\nI'm not convinced the BR breaker in a Siemens panel was the proximate cause: but it's enough to make a claim as you're not supposed to do that.  The more usual cause is improperly torqued connections getting warm, leading to a cascade of failure.  If your sparky did not use a calibrated torque wrench, there's another problem right there."", ""Yikes.   It might have been a counterfeit breaker.\n\nSince it melted at the busbar connection, it wasn't wires not torqued down enough.\n\nYou could be right that it wasn't a fully compatible breaker for that panel."", 'The breaker being incompatible, in this case, means that it physically fit in the bus bar but contact with the bus bar was deficient in some way?

To your third point, we have a very similar setup. I used 6 THHN on L1/L2/N and 10 THHN ground wire. Partially in conduit, about a 35 foot run, although I am informed it should all be in conduit (the portion in the attic above the garage is not in conduit at the moment).   \n\nI had to install a 125A sub panel next to the main panel because we did not have circuits available for the EV and other new garage outlets. The sub panel was bridged with 1/0 SER wire and ground bars linked with 1AWG copper.  All three of our air conditioners were moved over to that panel along with the new EV charger. \n\nFor the EV run, I am currently using a Tesla mobile charger on a NEMA 14-50 outlet using those 6AWG wires above. I will have a 60A breaker in there because we will likely install this same Emporia wall charger the OP is referencing. (I am currently using a 50A breaker for the 14-50 outlet). My questions are:\n(1) is wiring size acceptable for my configuration?  My research and permit planning says yes. \n(2) if his new electrician put a 50A breaker is there a way to hard limit the Output of the wall charger?

30’/9 metre EVSE cable,"I have a funny garage setup. Who doesn’t? 

The problem is that in order to charge two cars that just barely fit into the garage with room to walk around them, I need a cable that’s 30’ (9.1 metres) long. 

I only have one free spot on the wall where I can have the EVSE installed. It’s right next to the panel. 

My local electrical utility provides rebates if you choose from one of their preferred EVSEs. 

The one I prefer is the ChargePoint Home Flex. 

ChargePoint’s max cable length is 23’ (7 metres)

You cannot buy the EVSE without the cable for less money and then have your electrician supply you with a 30’ cable. You must purchase the 23’ cable. 

Can an electrician safely extend the OEM cable by 7’? 

Is it worth it? I feel like that would void whatever warranty on the EVSE.

Electrify America Charging Station fried my brand new EV seven months ago.,"Electrify America Charging Station fried my brand new EV seven months ago.  According the videos and pictures, ElectrifyAmerica charger supplied 271 kwh energy in 32 minutes with whopping cost of $129.60 of over charges.  When I called ElectrifyAmerica, their idiot supervisor and manager claimed ElectrifyAmerica did not cause the damages and hung up the calls when I asked for an executive who can handle the case.  

ElectrifyAmerica called a few weeks later, only after I posted pictures and videos of their malfunctioned charger on a social media site, in a very different tone.  The ElectrifyAmerica customer loyalty specialist, (J*****) admitted the problem and promised to compensate for the financial damages they caused.  The dealership could not fix my brand new EV in time, so the financial company made me to surrender my brand new EV with loss of around $7000.

I'm sure engineers on both sides, and maybe in standards organizations as well, are working pretty hard to understand how it has sometimes happened and to reduce the incidence to near zero.\n\nBut we also need a way to deal with it when it does happen, to figure out whether it was the fault of the charger or the car, or some kind of shared responsibility, and to make sure the consumer is taken care of.  \n\nIt sounds like in your case,  BMW has taken responsibility for it, if not directly, through the lemon law rules.

I don't know if they have a database such that when a car plugs in they have some general idea of its specs, such that if it requests energy more than double the size of the battery, they know something doesn't make sense.  If they don't have that, they might want to set it up. But on the face of it, if a vehicle requests 500 kW charging for half an hour, and the charger can supply that, it probably should, because that might be a large truck or transit bus or something and might need that.\n\nThere's also the fact that this station is probably rated at a maximum of 350 kilowatts, not 500 kW.  So I am puzzled by how it could have delivered that much energy. I'm also puzzled by how it could have delivered that much energy without causing more destruction of the car than what you describe.  Once the battery was full, if that energy was really delivered, it would have had to go into heating something, and that's a huge amount of heat that would melt whatever it was going into and destroy its ability to accept current in less than a minute.  So it may well be that the reading on the display there is not correct.  Which does then kind of complicate the issue because that does sound like there's at least some fault in the unit, not just the problem with the car.\n\nBut still, it should be BMW and perhaps your insurance company who are responsible to you, and if they want to blame Electrify America they should be the ones making the phone calls and having their own lawyers write letters."", ""I'd suggest it's time to stop talking to EA and start talking to an attorney."", '>Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nTalk to a lawyer.

The physics works either way, and it's an engineering choice which you do.  Feeding resistors with current sources is actually done regularly in electronics for analog circuits inside ICs, for example.\n\nAnd in fact, most battery charging is done by providing a controlled current to the battery.

App idea : What Features Would You Like in a Smart Energy Home App for EV Charging?,"Hi fellow Redditors! 

I’m working on a **Smart Energy Home Application** designed to help households optimize their energy consumption, especially for **electric vehicle (EV) charging**. The main goal is to help users **save money**, **maximize self-consumption of solar energy**, and make the most out of variable electricity prices.

Here’s what we’ve thought of so far:

**Mission:**

* Better consume and self-consume electricity.
* Optimize energy consumption based on production and electricity prices.
* Lower household electricity costs.

**Core Features (Must-Have):**

* Charge your EV when your solar panels (PV) are producing energy.
* Charge your EV when electricity prices are low.
* Keep a ""Boost"" or ""ASAP"" charging option for quick charges when you’re in a rush.

**Secondary Features (Nice-to-Have):**

* Charge your home battery based on PV production and electricity prices.
* Use your HVAC system (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) based on PV production and electricity prices.
* Predictive charging for EVs and batteries based on weather forecasts.

I’d love to hear from you:

* What other features would you find useful or exciting in such an app?
* Are there specific problems you’d want this app to solve for you?
* If you’re already using similar apps, what’s missing or could be improved?

Whether you own an EV, have solar panels, or are just passionate about energy efficiency, your insights would be invaluable! What are you missing in the existing app, or what would you like to see ?

That local API should be open (OCPP or similar). The main reason is the cloud DOES get lag, and the servers sometimes have reliability issues. When home, I don't want to deal with that, all problems should be able to be fixed by power cycling the EVSE.\n\nWith that I've implemented these features:\n\n1. Pull my vehicle info via the vehicle API (I have a Rivian)\n2. Use the vehicle info, and EVSE controls/info to implement departure charging (complete charging at a specific time)\n3. I check the weather, and switch between departure charging or based on grid conditions (I currently actually poll the utility for the daily demand forecasts, and attempt to charge at the lowest demand). Departure charging leaves the battery a little warmer, so I use it when it's cold enough that battery heating would run in the morning.\n\nWhat I would love, but don't currently do:\n\n1. The EVSE should be able to link to various solar systems, grab the data, and do solar based charging (I don't do this because my utility doesn't care)\n2. I **really really** want demand charging, that is the utility schedules the charging within a window I provide, and then offers some kind of discount for it. My utility does not offer this, and I think they should figure it out.\n\nAnd a nice to have would be general power forecasting/scheduling assistant. Pull down the utility TOU rates, analyze my power, and tell me the cost impacts of different things. Can my HVAC times be shifted? Can I chill my house down extra before peak rates. How fast would my house warm up with typical summer temps, how would this affect my electric bill. What about the hot water heater, can I raise the temp off peak, and lower it on peak, how would this affect my electric bill.

Plot twist, not every weekend is sunny - and that’s when everyone is home doing laundry and other things that soak up that solar energy. \n\nWe do have battery storage, but it isn’t enough.

Because the Juicebox implemented TOU charging by waiting for the cloud to issue start/stop commands, it didn't have a local timer.\n\nSimilarly, if it lost wifi in the middle of the night or something, it might stop charging. I think other people said they had internet outages, and they couldn't communicate with the Juicebox to start charging, and it wouldn't honor the schedule either because scheduling was done via the cloud.\n\nIt's very important that the EVSE has at least basic functionality that's locally controlled, so with there are cloud problems (and they WILL happen), or the user has internet problems (and again, they will happen), the basic features should still work.\n\nJuicebox even got so bad, they sold the devices saying they supported load balancing on a shared circuit, and then deleted the function with a cloud update.

Another melted NEMA outlet...,"Our NEMA 14-50 ev charging outlet in the garage has just melted for the third time in barely over a year. This is the smallest amount of damage we've had out of all the instances. I'm becoming very skilled in knowing what the odd smell in the garage is. ☹️ It is on a dedicated circuit with a 50 amp breaker. The electrician installed some kind of aluminum wire (not sure what gage). This was a spec home that came to us like this, we are the first owners but did not get to choose the options (i.e. i did not choose aluminum vs. copper wire, it was already installed when we bought the house).

After the first time it melted we installed a higher end Bryant outlet, which melted as well. Looking back the Bryant was only meant to be installed with copper wire which may have been part of the issue. The third time the installer used the same shrimpy outlet as the first time and no surprise, here we are again.

We are using a chargepoint home flex set to 32 amps. It requires copper wire if hard wired so that is not an option. This thing never gets unplugged, it stays plugged in constantly.

Any advice on how to get a better outlet when I'm stuck with aluminum wiring? All the good Bryant / Hubbel ones I've seen require copper wires. Also any advice on getting this thing done right the fourth time? I'm getting very frustrated as these are licensed electricians. I haven't had to pay for any of these changes because they are done under warranty but I have zero faith they will get it right this time or any other time and I have to use these electricians. Each time it happens I have to deal with the stress of a house fire barely avoided and the hassle of fighting with the electricians. When I have argued about replacing the wiring with copper, even offering to pay the difference, I'm told they can only replace ""like with like"" and that it would not be allowed. The outlet is not close to the electrical panel at all so it would be quite a long run (I'm estimating around 75 feet).

We had a NEMA 14-50 outlet setup at our previous home and it never melted or had any issues. Unfortunately due to the lack of problems we experienced, I was blissfully unaware of what was used in that installation (copper vs aluminum, what brand outlet, etc). So I am not sure what was done differently.",20,"['Splice the aluminum to copper with a properly torqued Polaris style connector.\n\nHardwire the copper into the EVSE.

30A vs 40A charger,"Hi everyone, I'm getting my level 2 charger installed at home this week and I got different opinions from various electricians.

I have a 200A electric panel (48KW) and my peak recorded usage is 21KW. However, one electrician told me that since I have an electric heating system of 15KW regulations only allow for a 30A charger since I have to keep a 20% buffer. Meaning my legally allowed max charge would be 38.4KW instead of 48KW.

I have asked 2 other electricians who told me they can install a 40A charger no problem and that I could even go up to 48A if I wanted to since I barely use any electricity at a peak record of 21KW when I could use 48KW. They both saw no issue with regulations.

I have no idea who to trust so it all comes down to this : Is the 40A charger worth it ? or should I just agree to a 30A and play it on the safer side ? Anyone has expirience with a 30A ? How long does it take to charge your car ? I own an Ioniq 5 Preferred Ultimate package.

My own experience and understanding is thin on this, and that doesn't help. I have seen the wiki page which is helpful.

I would very very much appreciate someone saying with specifics, ""Tell the electrician that you would like this, this, and this done.""

I wish I were smarter on this topic, and I would be glad for someone to ELI5.  Thank you very much.

**EDIT**: Here are some details that might be relevant that perhaps I should have included originally. (I told you I wasn't very good at this.)

I would like a hardwired EVSE about 40 feet across the backyard from the backdoor. The 100-amp electrical panel in this old house is just inside the back door.

Some electricians want to upgrade the panel (expensively). One felt certain that I could get 40 amp charging without a problem given that many of our appliances are gas-powered (furnace, dryer, hot water) and not electric. Seems like he may be right but his conclusion felt a little loosey-goosey and not so precise.

I have purchased a Grizzl-E unit with an eye toward such an installation but have begun to consider that load management might be smarter. I have tried to bring that up before with electricians but that part of the conversation never seems to get any traction.  Thank you.",7,"[""I recommend a different approach.

Not to mention, economies of scale will help to drop costs for such things in California.\n\nLastly, I really don't see being comparable in fuel cost to a highly efficient hybrid as a failure. You are talking worst case scenario here and EVs still come away as a highly economical option that is at the very least in the ballpark of the best ICE has to offer. That's a win. What's even more remarkable is if you're start looking at the LR or Performance trims you're getting the same efficiency but with the acceleration and performance of an ICE vehicle that would be getting 20mpg at best. Truly phenomenal. The one thing really holding hybrids back is the Prius' reputation for being economical but slow as can be.

Subpanel on a 30A breaker for dryer and charger,"Its an old house and here is picture of my 150A panel - https://imgur.com/a/9ePoWf6

Its a pretty full panel (2 kitchen and 2 laundry all electric) and a lot of tandem breakers. I think, I cannot add a quad breaker anymore to make space for a EV charger, correct? 

Slot 7 and 9 has a 30A breaker that feeds a dryer receptacle (old 10-30). Luckily, it looks like a 10/3 romex with a ground - https://imgur.com/a/aP93Xra 

The dryer room shares the wall with garage. I am proposing to my electrician that we add a sub-pabel in the dryer room with 2 x 30A interlocked breakers and feed one breaker to the dryer receptacle and run (10/2 or 10/3) wiring on the other breaker to feed a EV charger in the garage. 

My electrician is saying that 24A is slow for a car charger. I showed him [technology connections youtube video](https://youtu.be/Iyp_X3mwE1w?si=zMM4Q7YJkrlxa1X1&t=2142) and told him I am absolutely fine with that and I don’t need more speed than that since I drive less and 24A is still sufficient enough for a decent overnight charge

Next, he is saying that 10/3 wire (thats currently coming to the dryer from the panel) is not a good choice to carry continuous 24A load. Is that even a valid concern? 10/3 is rated for 30A so should be no problem to carry 24A on continuous load, correct? It’s a 30 year old house so could that be an issue? 

Should we replace the 30A breaker in slot 7 and 9 with a 60A breaker, run 6 gauge wire to a sub panel and then use 2 interlocked breakers to split between dryer (30A) and charger (60A)? We still may not hit 120-150A limit but is this even necessary because of the concern on 10/3 wire?",2,"[""Your main panel is a mess.

Will interlock the breakers so only 1 can run at a time. Dryer 1 is fed using a 30A double breaker (slot 7/9).

Luckily the Dryer 2 wiring can be re-routed to the subpanel somewhat easily. So no throw away wiring\n\nOption 3\n\nDisconnect Dryer 2 wiring from the 30A/20A quad breaker currently in slot 12/14.

Breaker Be Tripping,"Hi - I already had a 220v 20amp circuit running into my garage when I bought my car in March of this year (so it's been 8 months), so I extended the run and added a 20amp 220v outlet.  I've also got a NEMA 6-20 adapter for the Tesla Mobile Charger.  I am 100% sure that there is nothing else on this circuit.  

For 8 months this has been perfect, but for the past two nights, after being plugged in and charging for, sometimes an hour, sometimes two or three hours, the two-pole 20A breaker tripped.  Reset it, all is well for a few more hours, then, POP again...  I have no ideas on why except possibly the charger going bad.  There have been a couple instances where, if the charger was bumped while connected, it would then fault and need to be unplugged and plugged back in to reset itself.

Level 2 at home (rental),"I am picking up a Rivian next week and very excited. We don’t drive a lot of miles because my wife and I both work from home. I occasionally drive longer distances to visit customers. 
We rent our house, so I do not plan to put any permanent modifications to the house. I’m considering only using the L2 mobile charger that comes with the vehicle and plugging into an available dryer plug. I need about a 20ft extension cord to get from the dryer to the driveway, then plug the portable charger in there. 

If I can get 10mph in charging, it should be more than enough to charge overnight. 

One thing I’m slightly worried about is the dryer is a 10-30R on a 30amp breaker, so I need an adapter to 14-50.

I’m finding no need to get fancy until you know for sure you need it.\n\nAs others have said the dryer plugs aren’t meant for the sustained load of L2, and the issues of propping doors or extension cords aren’t worth the extra risk if you can get by with L1 anyways…..', ""As someone who owns rentable real estate myself, I would actually prefer you to have a hardwire EVSE versus a mobile charger.

You will love the truck, nothing else like it. Make sure you join r/Rivian .

The Rivian mobile charger is limited to either 30A or 32A so that it can be used with a 14-50 receptacle on a 40A circuit (this is a legal but uncommon combination). You cannot use this charger on a 30A circuit. I believe SplitVolt makes a charger for a 30A plug-in circuit. \n\nRunning an electrical cord (extension cord, power cord, or charging cable) through a doorway or window is also against code. Abrasion or pinching can cause damage, start fires, or pose a shock/electrocution hazard. While I would (and have) done it on a temporary expediency basis, I wouldn’t plan to do it regularly.

You’re thinking of combining adapter(s) and an extension cord on a breaker/outlet that’s probably not meant for 8-12 hours of continuous load and that’s just asking for a fire to happen, especially if it’s an older home.   Wires can heat up and melt, then short, and then boom. Fire while you’re sleeping. \n\nI would honestly ask your landlord if you pay for it, if they are ok with you adding a proper plug and circuit dedicated to EV charging. Most landlords seem to be ok with it as long as a licensed person does it (from what I’ve seen through friends and various Reddit subs). You have to eat the cost, yes, but you can safely and reliably charge your EV, and the landlord gets to use that as a selling point to their next renter when that time comes.

I don't really want to hire an electrician again. Will the NEMA 14-50 version work? I know it won't be 50A like the HW one will be. I also like that I would be able to plug in some other charger (if this one broke, for example).

Terminals that clamp the wire from both sides are better than ones that push a set screw into the wire.\n\n* Compact housing--doesn't always matter but looks better in an outdoor installation and fits better in a cramped old garage.\n\n* I like that it tracks kWh used, although I rarely look at that.\n\n* Configuration (e.g., of maximum current) via DIP switches internally.  This is vastly better than configuration in an app.  (1) It's more trustworthy.  It's easier to be sure a software update or glitch doesn't nuke the settings and overload the wiring AND it's more likely to keep working even if the company goes out of business.  (2) An installer doesn't want to mess around with installing another app and figuring out the menus.  Setting the switches while it's already opened up to do the wiring is much faster in the installer's workflow.\n\n2\\. With L2 charging, pretty much none at home; at public stations, however:\n\n* Equipment that languishes with zero maintenance and is likely to be  broken when you arrive.\n\n* Cables left on the ground, getting dirt in the plug.\n\n* Surprising high prices, only visible in the app, not posted.\n\n* Need for cell phone signal to activate, but the charger is in a parking garage or remote mountain valley where the signal is weak.\n\n5\\. Wish list:\n\n* For home charging, I wish the J1772 connector had a built in flashlight that would activate when I take it off the holster and turn off when it's in the port.\n\n* For payments, I wish there was a contactless credit card reader, so I can pay with a credit card without an account and without an app or cell signal.\n\n* Sure, battery percentage would be great but that's not in the standards yet for L2 communications.  But I haven't read J3400--maybe that provides a path for it?  Fortunately, my car provides all I need in that regard but not all do.\n\n* There are few brands that offer real load management solutions.  And those that do have limitations:\n\n * For Wallbox, the measurement module is expensive, in part because it's a power meter than measures more parameter than needed--it only needs to monitor current.\n\n * For Emporia, the whole system is too cloud dependent.  Also, the system needs a minimum dedicated 6 A capacity; that shouldn't be necessary.\n\n * For Tesla, the measurement module isn't sold directly, forcing use of an installer in their network.\n\n * Generally, there's a lack of comprehensive features--you should be able to configure multiple units on a shared circuit or shared power allocation in combination with load management on the feeder current.  And my personal request is the ability to manage it based on two feeders, the main feed to the building and the subpanel feeder, as described in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/evcharging/comments/1g2a2vh/creative_use_of_wallbox_load_management_on/).  Although that makes it sounds like a very special cast, garage subpanels, particularly for outbuildings, are pretty common, and the feeders were often sized for much lower loads than we are talking about now.  And this capability is also useful for apartment complexes where you want to manage the feeder to the whole complex and the feeder to whatever panel the charger is on.\n\n* If you include a plug-in option, include a temperature sensor in the plug.  No excuses.  If you can't be bothered with that, make it hardwire only.  \n\n* Expand the current configuration options, not just 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48.  44 A is useful for maximum utilization of 6 AWG Romex.  20, 12, 10, 8 and 6 A are useful for situations where the load calc doesn't leave room for the 16 or 24 A.  Although if you make load management easy and cheap, those lower current ones are less important.\n\n* If you are new on the market, I'll trust it more if it's in a metal case.  Grizzl-E had quality control problems that could have burned down a lot of houses, but the metal case prevented the fire from spreading.\n\n* Terminals that accept aluminum wire would be nice.  Including aluminum wire that's oversized for the maximum current that you can handle, because Al wire is often used because you have a long run where Cu would be expensive, and oversizing for a long run is popular.\n\n* Consider untethered cables, only just becoming permitting in the US under J3400.  Useful and not a lot of competition yet.\n\n* If you white-label a product designed by engineers from a different company, don't lie about it.  Tell the truth.  There's no shame in co-developing with a contract manufacturer, but some companies dig themselves into a hole lying about it.\n\n* It seems like there's a bit of a shortage of products meant for apartment buildings or condos.  There are products where it's pay per use, open to the general public, and there are products that have free charging available only to people with an RFID card.  But products that track usage per user, leaving it to the site managers to bill them, seem relatively rare.  I'm not sure how popular that would be.  \n\n* Ability to enable/disable with a simple contact closure on low-voltage wires is a feature that Clipper Creek used to offer that is useful in a wide variety of special situations and would be really easy to include, but that is hard to find.  For example, locate the switch inside the house, to easily turn it on for residents (or air-bnb guests) but not for other users.  Or a switch at the front desk of a hotel, to enable it for guests only.  It would could be used with simple 3rd-party load management systems."", 'Wheelchair accessibility! (At public locations)', 'Another idea: make a 24 A hardwire unit, with DIP switches inside to configure for 24, 20, 16, 12, or 8 A charging.  It will be cheaper and smaller than the standard 48 A units and nicer to use with a lighter weight cable.  And most importantly, **nobody else is making one** so even if the market for that is only 3% of the total market, you get that 3% all for your company.', 'Here\'s a softball request. Most EVSEs let you select 32, 40 or 48A and skip over 44A.  Why is 44A important?  Because everybody grabs for #6 Romex when cabling an EV station.  #6 Romex is actually 55A wire, see NEC 334.80 and 310.16. No, 310.12 and 240.4(B) do not let you run 60A.   Further, EVs are treated as continuous loads, so you can only use 80% of the 55A = 44A.  We correct several people a week and they\'re NOT happy having to derate to 40A simply because their manufacturer gave them no choice. \n\nSoftball request #2.  First any modern EVSE needs to have a ""safety adjustment"" that lets you select 6 amps, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, again 44, and 48 amps just to be competitive.  This must be ""made difficult to change"" via UL rules, repeated here in section 4.   However, some EVSEs also offer a ""user-facing soft setting"" which is allowed to adjust anywhere from 6 amps to the ""safety setting"".  Please put verbiage on that screen to warn people not to use it for a safety setting.', '# Hardball request #1: ALUMINUM WIRE FOR PETE\'S SAKE\n\nElectricians don\'t use copper wire for circuits this large.  They use aluminum. **The ONLY people who use copper for big 60A+ circuits are the EV gang** because there\'s a gun to their head. No EV manufacturer will provide aluminum-rated terminals.  I\'ll get into the reasons next section.   For pete\'s sake [look at this teardown of the Siemens Versicharge!](https://youtu.be/RMxB7zA-e4Y?si=kiebJAxXcDHHn-hZ&t=492)  The electrician attaches wires to these shitty Euroterminals that are copper-only, and they hop immediately to a contactor with aluminum (rated) terminals!  Why not just attach the EVSE\'s power to an auxiliary contact on the contactor, and let us use the aluminum-rated terminals on the contactor for Pete\'s sake?  \n\nPlease - most large terminals are aluminum rated, yet EVSE makers swerve out of there way to use these very non-North-American terminals which can\'t do aluminum. STOP. Honestly.   But since #6 aluminum maxes out at 50A, that segues to: \n\n# Hardball request #2: Make the wireway room for #4 and larger wires. \n\nYes, I know everyone stops at #6 because of UL\'s tough rules on wire bending space for #4 and above. This is a nightmare that feeds back to the 55A problem mentioned elsewhere.  Tesla overcame it by providing ample wireways.  Do something like that.   But Tesla stopped at #4, please go farther and support #2.  Once you\'re into aluminum terminals, it\'s an easy hop.  \n\nWhy is that important? #1 you need larger wire sizes for aluminum wire (and for copper wire if it\'s NM or UF types, where #6=55A and #4=70A).  And #2, we see lots of terminal burn-ups in EV stations, and a number of house fires - ask Randall Cobb.  The common factor is they are running the wires at 60C thermal limits, and because of the ""continuous load"" nature of EV charging, this is placing undue thermal stress on the terminals.  \n\nWire thermal rise is the square of wire amps (work it out through Ohm\'s Law and Watt\'s Law).  So by enlarging wire even 1 size, you significantly cool the wire.  Now instead of shoving heat into the terminals, the oversized cool-running wire is pulling heat away from the terminals.  \n\nAnd if we\'re supporting aluminum wire, why NOT oversize? The stuff is CHEAP.  In fact, there\'s a price/availability/performance ""sweet spot"" at 2 AWG aluminum (which also obeys my ""increase 1 wire size"" rule since #4AL is only 65A).  \n\nIf I\'m doing a commercial site install of multiple units, being able to use cheaper wire is going to get my attention.  The obsession of EV stations with small copper wire is \\*boggles my mind\\* inexplicable. It\'s insane. Worst case ever of not listening to installers. \n\nAnd if I\'m honest, this is responsible for a lot of house fires, because of the impossibility of oversizing the wires vs. customer expectations of the Fastest Charge Possible(tm).', 'Mediumball requests\n\nAnd I\'ll group these because in this forum, these are the three we are always talking about, and this drives us to three specific models of EVSE (not one each).  Frankly if you\'re not going to support these, stay home, we don\'t need another also-ran station to have to tell people that they can\'t use because of their situation. \n\n# Dynamic Load Management\n\nThis talks to a power module in the service panel, which constantly reports the amp draw from the 2-3 service wires, on which it has CT clamp meters.   The EVSE takes this real-time signal, does a tiny bit of math, and adjusts the amp rate being told to the EV, so that the service panel cannot overload and/or exceed the target number configured into it.  Currently supported by Wallbox, Emporia and Tesla Wall Connector. Try to choose a generic / multiple choice CT module so we aren\'t supplier-locked and unable to install your stations due to lack of supply. \n\n# Solar Capture\n\nThis is very similar to DLM above, except that instead of preventing panel overload, it is preventing solar export. This benefits people on NON-net-metering plans, where they pay e.g. 20 cents a kWH for electricity but are only paid 4 cents a kWH for the solar they generate.  \n\nSolar Capture is monitoring amps just the same except adjusting EV charge rate so the EV soaks up exactly the amps that would be otherwise exported to the utility. \n\nRight now Emporia and Wallbox support this. Tesla Wall Connector does not because Tesla went a different way with that concept (Tesla Brand Solar talks to Tesla Brand Cars and the EVSE is not involved). \n\n# Group Load Management aka Power Sharing \n\nIn this setup, multiple EVSEs are grouped, either via radio signaling as Tesla does, or with hard lines as Wallbox does.  \n\nIn current implementations, the group is told ""you may have a fixed power allocation of \\_\\_ amps"" e.g. 70 amps.  They then dynamically split that amongst the stations that are actively charging.  E.G. with 1 car charging they split 48/0/0/0 amps.  When a second car arrives, they split 35/35/0/0.  With three it becomes 27/27/26/0.  When one car finishes, it becaomes 0/35/35/0 you get the idea. \n\n# BOTH Dynamic Load Management AND Power Sharing at once\n\nThis is the holy grail of EV charging design.  Nobody covers this in the US market. Wallbox does in Europe. \n\nIn this case we\'re doing Power Sharing, but instead of sharing a fixed \\_\\_ amps e.g. 70 amps, we are sharing a dynamically changing number based on Dynamic Load Management.  This is the thing we will really really need going forward, when houses with limited e.g. 100A electric services get their second EV.  \n\nBut another place it\'ll be used is commercial.  You don\'t have any power for EV stations but you have a huge 3-phase air conditioner?  OK, we\'re going to put three Dynamic Load Management stations off the three 277V phases of the air conditioner.  When the A/C kicks on, EV charging slows or stops. Then it resumes.    Well, if we can stack Power Sharing on top of that, now we can support 3-4 stations per phase instead of only 1.', 'Thank you all for the great advice.

"Charge Point home charger is connected to a DCC but the breaker keeps overloading and blowing, never tripped.","Hi all,

I used to have a Tesla charger that was installed with a DCC and had no problems for almost 2 years. Got a Charge Point install instead when I got a new car. After using. The charger for 3 months it stopped working. Long story short for a replacement from charge point and a electrician came out and found 3 breakers were overloaded and blown. So he replaced them it worked for 5 months and then the car charger breaker overloaded again and blew. Never seen it trip and it changed my car fine for those 5 months. But once it overloaded I noticed there was a problem as the charger had no pot and the breaker was loose.

Called an electrician and they found that my sub-panel box bus is completely fried. But have no idea what caused it to get fried nor the overloading. The charger app is set to 50 amp break. The DCC is set to 50 amp breaker and. 40 am out the breaker was a 50 amp breaker. This was set by the installer. They said the fried bus could be the reason overloading is happening but not 100% sure. The sub panel needs to be replaced. So I had an insurance investigator come out an they said that the breaker is overloaded and that doesn't happen because of a fried bus but they also didn't know anything about chargers or DCC. So I believe the electrician more than the investigator.  My question is has anyone else had this problem? Does it make sense that a fried bus can cause this issue? Why doesn't the breakers trip? Also better seems to be an issue when I am changing, I only notice a problem where erhe charger isn't getting power like a few days to a week after I used the charger.

sub-panel",2,"[""Fried bus = melted/distorted bus bar?\n\nIt's hard to say what the causal direction was here. BUT, invariant to that, is the fact that the damaged bus can easily cause the breakers to not behave properly, via multiple imaginable mechanisms (EG increasing the resistance in the path / throwing heat into the components from the wrong direction).\n\nGiven that we are talking about a house, not a hospital, plane, or spaceship, I think the best you can do is replace all components with damage / things adjacent to them, and have it all torqued etc. You may need to accept that a detailed root cause analysis is not going to happen, and to be frank the level of details we can exchange on Reddit is not going to result in good progress towards that."", 'A fried bus can cause a breaker to trip.  On the other hand, some different problem could cause a breaker to trip and cause a fried bus.  If you were to provide pictures, we could judge much better.', 'Those bars down there that the breakers clip onto are called ""bus stabs"".\n\nThe pictures show melting between the breaker and bus stab.  This is caused by ""arcing"": a poor connection which has too little metal in contact overheating, then melting, then causing electricity to ""jump the gap"" creating pretty much arc-welding.\n\nThat extreme heat, which you can see has destroyed the breaker\'s bus clips, also heats up the breaker\'s metal components, including the bimetal strip which is designed to detect overload.  The bimetal strip thinks this heat is from the amps of current going through it - it\'s not, it\'s from the bus melting.\n\nOnce a bus stab is damaged, the entire bus stab is condemned. It cannot be used anymore - neither side.  So it takes out 2-4 breaker spaces.   If the damage is severe, the panel is scrap and must be replaced.\n\n\\-----\n\nWhy does this happen?  A previously damaged or corroded bus, a previously damaged breaker, or the incorrect breaker type for that panel.  Although all the 1"" breakers seem to interchange, the bus clips are different, and they don\'t survive UL testing in competitor panels. That\'s why UL doesn\'t approve them for cross-use.\n\n~~Looking at the bus, that distinctive zigzag insulator (with beveled corners) only shows up in Murray/ITE panels, both which are brands of Siemens.  They take Siemens QP type breaker.  Siemens has re-branded their Murray and ITE trade names to Siemens. They got a UL letter confirming QP breakers are compatible with type MP breakers.~~\n\n**Edit: I am no longer confident in the Murray/Siemens assessment.  Other aspects closer resemble BRyant for which Eaton BR is the correct breaker.**  \n\nThe breaker there looks an awful lot like an Eaton BR type.  That does not belong in a Murray panel.  This is to be expected with the incorrect breaker in the bus.\n\nThe one above it looks like Eaton as well.\n\nSo no more ""alien breakers"". Be a complete dick about making sure every breaker type in your panel is a type listed on the panel labeling.  Make the ""electrician"" fix it. That is his job, the code violation is NEC 110.3(B).\n\n\\-----\n\nThe panel you have now is 12 space/24 circuit main-lug panel.  It is heavily ""double-stuffed"" with tandems including 18 total circuits. Any modern panel can serve as a replacement, however, relying on tandems is a bad idea, so I strongly rcommend at least a 24-space panel., 30 would be better.  **Spaces are cheap**.  Scrimping on spaces is the stupidest decision in electrical.  *If this powers a whole house, accept nothing less than 40-space.  Really*.\n\nNow look at your car\'s tires, see where it says 112 MPH Speed Rating? You\'re not REQUIRED to drive that fast!  So most 24-40 space panels will be 200 amp Speed Rating. That\'s fine.  Don\'t exceed that :) is all that means.  A main-breaker panel is fine; the main breaker would just act as a disconnect. I gather your house has a proper main breaker somewhere else... a 100A main feeding a 200A subpanel is totally fine.  It\'s like if 1 corner of your car has an 85 MPH tire, that\'s fine, don\'t exceed 85.\n\nI**f you want a higher quality panel less likely to have problems like this, consider Eaton ""CH"" or Square D ""QO"" panels, which are their ""high-end"" panels.**  They also have very unique bus designs, so incompatible breakers simply will not fit.  That prevents THIS from happening again.  However, tandem breakers have low availability in CH/QO, so you can\'t fool around with breaker spaces, you need plenty. Take the ""at least 24 preferably 40"" to heart.  Good news, those panels are smaller because the breakers are shorter.\n\nAnd Eaton CH is a fantastic brand, despite your bad experience with misapplied Eaton BR.', ""Those bus stabs look pretty oxidized and rough.   Given the age of the panel, it doesn't really surprise me.  That little bit of roughness is enough to cause heating at the breaker connection point, causing these failures."", 'FYI when I said it was SIemens lineage, I am now doubting that based on tuctrohs data.  I was too focused on the odd beveled bus bar insulator and didn\'t look at any other characteristics. I now see more markers that point to BRyant.  So the breaker was correct.  \n\nPerhaps the problem was the ""higher than I\'d like to see"" level of surface oxidation on the bus bars. They shouldn\'t be tan.', ""The other thing you can reliably do to manage risk is to turn the charge rate down to the minimum you need for your commute requirements. 16A is a lot less stress on the components than 40A.\n\nBy reliable, I mean at least: It will meaningfully decrease risk from a physics angle. You don't need to trust the electricians to quality check the work / don't have to worry about DCC, ChargePoint, electricians pointing fingers at each other if things break again. Objectively speaking, in  a properly working society the electrician's warranty on the repair work should cover it. But this may be overly naive.\n\nI guess you can also camp on the electricians looking at them work and making them show the torque on every breaker (or at least the important ones). My AHJ inspectors will do this for some terminals."", ""Hi, I am trying to figure out how to upload the pictures that the electrician sent me. The problem is more that the breaker isn't tripping but completely overloading and blowing."", ""Thank you, Having the wrong breakers in the box, makes sense as the previous owners did a lot of repairs that were incorrect and clearly done by the cheapest person they could find, there was a lot of corrosion to appliances that were in the inspection reports, a shower had a colored and not working handle and sprout. The dishwasher was installed wrong and putting overflow back into the dishwasher. So make sense that they probably just went to Home Depot to replace bad breakers but didn't know what to buy. \n\nThe electrical that I am hiring is charging 1200 for a new sub-panel and will be providing a breaker package when they replace it. Bu tit doesn't say what the panel brand is. I will ask what brand it is. But the electrical company has installed solar and car chargers, so fingers crossed they will bring a panel of a reliable brand. \n\nThank you so much for this explanation.

After they replace the sub-panel, I will see if they know what I should set the charger to that would be a better saying. What you are saying makes sense. It is possible there as more wrong with this sub panel as there is a post note I noticed form the previous owners that talked about having trouble with tripping breakers back to on and having to press hard and the panel was installed upside down, which makes me thing that the previous owners had issues and just paid for cheap help to fix them. there was a lot of wrong things with the house appliances and some other areas that were installed incorrectly, according to a contractor, and lots of issues not in the home inspection reports."", 'Two ways--upload to Imgur and drop a link in a comment, or post ""to your profile"" and drop an link in a comment.\n\nPicture of the whole setup as well as the damage would explain the setup faster than a lot of back and forth.', 'If you don\'t specifically tell/force them to use a particular brand, they are going to get ""whatever"" and the smallest panel that will do the job.

Ground connected to neutral with no GFCI breaker — code violation?,"Hi all,

I had an electrician (well, I later found out he doesn’t have a C-10 license in California; he said he's ""certified,"" which I believe means he's a journeyman) install a charger in my garage last year. I decided to replace the Leviton receptacle he installed with a Hubbell I just purchased. When I opened up the plate, ~~I realized it's a bootlegged ground. I remember reading somewhere that a bootlegged ground is a code violation in California unless it’s paired with a GFCI circuit breaker (which in my case, it's~~ **~~NOT~~** ~~a GFCI breaker)~~. Given that this was a new installation, why would he skip the ground? Is it because the house is old (mid-1970s)?

Question — How bad is this? Should I find someone else to fix this problem, or should I proceed with swapping out the receptacle?

Edit:

According to my EVSE's manual, a GFCI breaker should not be used.

"DIY level 2 charging station install at home, legally.","Ok, so I read tons of electrical code docs, watched many great experts on Youtube. I had electrical schooling way back when, but ended up pursuing a different path. I really do feel that I can absolutely safely install an EV charging station at my home.

I'm in Ontario Canada. The safety governing body is ESA (Electrical Safety Authority), which is probably pretty much identical to any of the governing bodies across Canada and the US.

The ESA site says that one \*MUST\* obtain a permit \*BEFORE\* the work, and that this involves an inspector verifying the work.

They also stress to get a licensed electrician to do the work. And that's where I want to cut a corner. They don't state that I \*MUST\* use an electrician. Apparently, it \*IS\* legal to do the work myself. Just that it must be signed off on by the inspector.

So the plan is to have a charging station at the outside of the house against the outside garage wall, such that I can charge my EV outside. The breaker panel is in the basement, and it's possible to drill a hole at the top of the wall near the breaker panel to create a path to the garage.

What I want to do is go the highest quality route: a certified charging station mounted on the outside wall of the garage, onto a sheet of multiplex wood. The wire comes in at the back of the charging station, though a hole from the inside of the garage. Hardwired, so no 14-50 plug. 6/2 Romex wiring inside conduit (metal obviously), where the conduit is mounted against the walls inside the garage, using conduit bodies and short radius corner bodies to get around corners. Ultimately, there is this one Romex wire, with two leads (240V) and ground, leading to the breaker panel. It's nicely protected by being inside that conduit inside the garage.

I can't see any potential safety problems here. It's one continuous set of wires. No unnecessary junction boxes. The charging station is at the other side, outside, on the wall, and the wire comes in through the wall, into the back to that charging station.  
Yes, it's high power, high amps (60 breaker, 48A max, #6 wire), but I can't see any opportunity for any weaknesses. No questionable connections. First connection is at the 60A breaker in the breaker box. Next connection is inside the charger station box. Wire, Romex NM-b wire that is, is inside conduit the moment it enters the garage.

So the plan is to apply for the permit, wait until I get the go ahead, install, and have an inspector go over the results.

Question is, \*CAN\* I do this without a licensed electrician? I know they discourage doing this yourself, and they stress using a licensed electrician, but if I'm confident and informed enough, it appears to be legal to do this job entirely myself. So can I?",6,"[""First: if you're doing conduit, use THWN instead of NM-B. You'll hate yourself for having to pull NM-B through conduit.\n\nSecond: count your bends.

First that\'s illegal, and second, it makes a very big mess of the work area, and you\'re forced to do the whole job in one sitting, which invites crap shortcutted work due to the need to finish.  Done properly, the work area is quite small as you\'re only working in one small area at a time.\n\n\\> Question is, \\*CAN\\* I do this without a licensed electrician?\n\nYes.

I think it will depend on how hardwiring is done with the charging station. Either it expects a wire to enter the station, or else the station already has a cable coming out where you\'re expected to connect it to a junction box. I have not sorted that bit out yet.

I pointed that thing at the breaker box the other day, and saw 3 breakers stand out a bit. I forgot what the temperature was, but it's not that much higher than ambient.

Afaik MC is like Romex with a metallic (usually aluminum) armor plus the ground wire is either insulated or not, and is full sized, so same gauge as the other wires. AC uses steel armor (more expensive). MC uses better insulation (AC uses paper?). I have not finished learning about grounding differences between the two, so I must first fully understand that before further considering armored cable.  \nI initially though that conduit is the most fool proof and simplest, but working a vertical steel support beam that sticks out from the wall, is more difficult with conduit, as it needs 4 x 90 degree corners. This only becomes harder to pull wire through it, however, it can be left open during construction until the wire is in the right space. Anyway, all this is terribly difficult to overcome, but yeah, armored cable is simpler.

The dicey part is that last part where one inserts a breaker and attaches wiring. There are load calculations to consider. Breakers specify screw torque (I bet that\'s not always done, and that it is done by feel though).So to apply for a permit, does one include a rundown of the load on the whole system, to demonstrate there is room for a 2 phase (technically not phases, but that\'s another whole story - it\'s two ends in a transformer coil, where neutral is the middle, and the two ""phases"" each end of the coil - they\'re 180 degrees apart, and they\'re not actual phases because actual phases are 120 degrees apart and 3 phases is what the grid is made up of - those phases are generated by the round motion action in a generator at the power plant).\n\nOk so, do everything, and stop short of handling the breaker box, and have an electrician take it from there.

I would not have, however, as:  \n1) A 20A receptacle is basically constructed the same as a 15A one, just a different shape. There are various tear downs demonstrating a side by side.  \n2) The same faulty or subpar connection to the receptacle and/or the prongs not making perfect contact and/or the the plug and its connections inside it, would have occurred. A 20A setup does not magically make it safer than 15A setup. The size of wires isn't the problem at all, as that gets luke warm at best. That's not where the weakness is. It's the connections by far. My solution was simple: replace receptacle and replace the plug. Result is the warming/heating problem is entirely gone now.  \nAnyway... that's just me going on about where the false senses of security are (20A being magic when it is not).  \nPoint is this: make the same mistakes of subpar contacts on a 48A continuous load setup, and face a huge risk.  \nThis requires torque specific connections on the breaker.

That cable has an RV plug and it can further be unrolled to lead a bunch of meters away from the garage where a portable generator can be placed out in the open. A number of smaller features in the house are connected through that secondary panel. A few lights circuits and receptacles, water pump, furnace, that's about it.

NEMA 14-50R was installed by local, licensed electrician in November 2022.  Used with a 32A charger to charge Chrysler Pacific PHEV until switched in April 2023 to a Grizzl-e Duo to charge the Pacifica and a Subaru Solterra.   Duo's dip switches set to 40A.  No problems until December 2023, when the NEMA plug burned.  See linked image.

Called a different electrician who said the prior job was not sufficient b/c it used 8AWG wire, not 6AWG, and the Leviton 14-50r isn't ""industrial.""  That seems to be supported by lots of threads in Reddit and elsewhere.  It's on a 50A breaker, and the 14-50r is only about 6 inches from the breaker box, so maybe 24"" of wire, if that matters. https://imgur.com/go27GsD 

When the circuit breaker popped, it also took out the whole-house breaker with it.  The receptacle's plastic coated the Duo's plug when I unplugged it.  See photo.  https://imgur.com/4ow1yQK

Duo's cord from plug to charging box was very hot, too.

They tripped from short circuit.   I did say that wires that are overloaded carbonize. I should have used the word overheated, rather than overloaded in that first sentence. In the end, there was more resistance, from somewhere, that caused overheating that melted and charred the insulation.  But also, overload is also technically correct, as I explain later on.\t\n\n>     The bad connection was probably not between the plug blades and the receptacle, but between the terminal and the wire. That problem is solved by using a better receptacle and tightening the connection with a torque wrench.\n> \n\nProbably?  There\'s no way to tell if it was torqued correctly after the fact.  It\'s been too destroyed to tell, and certainly not by looking at a picture. I agree that properly torquing the larger amp EV outlets is absolutely required, doesn\'t get done as often as it should, and that it requires wiggle testing it and pushing the outlet in to place and then removing it and checking torque to be effective.  And that many non industrial electricians do not take the time to do that. I acknowledge that. \n\nSo if residential electricians are not torquing 14-30 and 14-50 outlets properly, why don\'t oven and dryer outlets melt every day? Why is it just EV outlets?  Because they only get something plugged in and unplugged once every 5 years or decade.  They don\'t WEAR OUT and their duty load cycles are much less extreme than EV charging. And they also pick the correct wire gauge for the breaker most of the time.\n\nBut one thing is clear, that other socket hole is also melted!  Not as much as the other side, but it\'s clear that there\'s clearly overheating on both sides of that socket! It\'s not just one badly torqued connection that melted this thing down, it\'s not just one bad connection to a blade. Whatever caused this was causing it on BOTH L1 and L2 current carrying pins!  And both pins carried exactly the same amps. You notice what\'s NOT melted?  The ground and neutral pins!   It\'s not like one bad connection melted the whole socket, there are multiple culprits here!  I\'m going with a worn outlet exasperated by number 8 wire.  One side was just more worn than the other. But both sides were on their way to failure eventually. \n\nI would also invite the OP to check the plug blade thickness with a caliper to see if it meets NEC width/thickness standards.   EV charger makers buy their cords from a 3rd party, and if that 3rd party goes cheap with a thin blade, there\'s less pressure against the outlet\'s contacts. \n\n\n>     The two specific causes listed, wear over time and number 8 wire are not really the right explanation.\n\nYes, they are.  And the OP\'s second electrician agreed. \n\n> Number 8 wire is fine although number six would give you more safety margin for other problems.

Exasperated by high duty cycle loads beyond any normal household load (dryer or oven) that EV chargers place on outlet. Exasperated by number 8 wire being used for a 40 amp load when it should have been 32 amps. (or number 6 wire at 40 amps). Overload.  By definition overload!    Heat cycles are included as ""wear.""  The proof was that it was fine for a while.  Until it wasn\'t.  It got worse over time. A disaster is just a coincidental occurance of enough causes all happening at the same time.  Any one of them would have been fine without the others.\n\nHowever, no matter what caused it, an EV charger with a temp sensor in the plug would have prevented it.  Period.  GM made their charger manufacturer have a temp sensor in their plug they ship with the Bolt.  Tesla knows this and temp sensors are in all their portable chargers. Nissan apparently does it with the Leaf\'s included factory charger.  \n\n\nDoes the Grizzl-e have a temp sensor?  Why or why not?', ""I'm very thankful to @tuctrohs, @put_tape_on_it  and the others in this thread for the very, very helpful advice.  I've tried to follow it.  \n\nThis thread's advice and the detailed discussions of code, environmental and other factors are also a very strong reason to hire a (competent) electrician, IMO.  \n\nRegarding the facts I hadn't known to included in the original post, to my knowledge, the Leviton 14-50R could not had a plug inserted / removed more than five times, probably less.  The Duo was plugged into it once, in April and never unplugged until the failure.  This garage lacks HVAC and is located in hot, Southwest Florida. \n\nHere's an UPDATE.\n\nThe electrician thought the Leviton was almost certainly the problem but also replaced the 8AWG wiring and 6AWG wiring after I said I'd feel safer charging up to three cars at night in the garage while the family is sleeping if that offered an additional safety factor.  Since the General Contractor who had sent the original electrician agreed to pay for fixing BOTH EV charging installs, the wiring cost of going to #6 wasn't an issue.  That's a good reason to try to hire someone competent and reputable.  While the original electrician failed, the GC stood behind the job.  \n\nThe Grizzl-e Duo is working fine, after the Bryant 14-50R was installed, today.  The Duo's plug had been ruined by the melting outlet's plastic, but electrician saved me some money and time waiting for the replacement.  When he ran new 6AWG wiring to the garage's second charger (a Grizzl-e Classic regularly pulling 40A from a Leviton 14-50R installed by same, original electrician), he hardwired it instead of replacing the Leviton with a Bryant receptacle.  This allowed him to use the Classic's plug cord to replace the destroyed Duo's plug cord.  So, the failed outlet was upgraded to a Bryant 9450FR but the other EV charger outlet in the garage that had not failed (yet) was converted to hardwiring per the many suggestions in this thread.  \n\nThanks!!\n\nOne lingering question, if I turn off the breaker, test to confirm there's no juice to the Bryant outlet, then want to confirm it's properly torqued to 75 lb-in, is there a trick to holding the outlet stable?  Seems like it would be pretty hard to hold the wired outlet in my hand while torquing to 75 lb-in since it's wired and close to the box / wall."", 'Yeah, I was like that is a really stuffed box.', ""This is not symptomatic of a problem with the Duo.  it's the classic failure of a Leviton receptacle.

The other essential steps are:\n\n* Replacing the receptacle with a Hubble or Bryant 9450 industrial grade receptacle.\n\n* Torquing them to spec with an appropriate tool.

That\'s what I was pointing out. We agree.  All good.\n\n>So if residential electricians are not torquing 14-30 and 14-50 outlets properly\n\nFirst, I am not making a strong claim that that\'s the cause of failure.  The low-performance terminals on the Leviton that are a uniquely poor design are equally suspect.  The combination is of course worse. Second, it is well known that residential electricians have not been torquing hardly anything properly until very recently and even then, a minority of them on a minority of terminals.\n\n>, why don\'t oven and dryer outlets melt every day? Why is it just EV outlets? \n\nBecause the duty cycle is vastly different.  Full power to preheat the oven for 10 minutes while using the cooktop is much less severe than 4 to 8 hours of steady 40 A.  As you yourself say, ""high duty cycle loads beyond any normal household load (dryer or oven) that EV chargers place on outlet. "" \n\n>Because they only get something plugged in and unplugged once every 5 years or decade. They don\'t WEAR OUT and their duty load cycles are much less extreme than EV charging. And they also pick the correct wire gauge for the breaker most of the time.\n\nThat\'s logical but asserting it without evidence and in the face of counter evidence is not going to convince me.  When we get once of these reports people jump  in blaming that, and as often as not, it turns out that OP plugged it in once and left it, or has a number of cycles on it that you can count on one hand.  The Grizzl-E Duo is not a portable unit that ones plugs and unplugs regularly, so this meltdown doesn\'t offer evidence for that, unless OP weighs in with a report of some such usage.  \n\n> it\'s clear that there\'s clearly overheating on both sides of that socket! \n\nI appreciate your careful observation of that.  There are multiple possible causes, including:\n\n* It looks to me like the insulation melt-through happened between the two hots, very close to the terminal of one that\'s in better shape.  When that short occurred it would have heated that terminal rapidly, and that could conduct through and melt the front slot.  That could have happened at the N, and then that would look worse, but either because the other L wire was warm to start and thus the insulation melted more easily, or just because of how they are situated.\n\n* Another bad terminal connection, caused by the bad design of the Leviton, possibly, but not necessarily, in combination with under torque.\n\n* The thermal event inside the box was severe.  There\'s a lot of soot and heat damage.  Some of that may have vented through the other hot terminal slot.  That probably doesn\'t explain the melted slot in the plastic, but it could explain the char on the plug blade.  It does look like that\'s worse than the N, as you point out, but we don\'t have a clear view of the N blade.\n\n>number 8 wire being used for a 40 amp load when it should have been 32 amps.\n\nWhat are you saying there exactly?  ""should have been"" as in u/put_tape_on_it recommends that, or are you saying that\'s the correct sizing per code?  \n\n>Heat cycles are included as ""wear."" \n\nIf you really mean that, then all of this back and forth has been a waste of time.  We agree that it\'s heat cycling not mechanical cycling. The heat cycling is not a problem for the plug blade interface--it\'s a problem for the wire terminal.\n\nThe Grizzl-E does not include a temperature sensor in the plug.  I don\'t know why, but I don\'t think highly of G-E so I\'m not surprised that they don\'t have best practice there.  I\'ve also measured a G-E power cord as higher something like 5X higher resistance in one hot from blade to terminal than in the other hot lead.  I assume that\'s a bad crimp in the plug.  And we\'ve had a report of a failure caused by likely the same problem in a G-E power cord.  I was impressed with them at first, but there products are not actually that great.\n\nA better question is why better companies like Wallbox, Chargepoint and Emporia don\'t have temperature sensors in their plugs.  I think they should, but they probably would counter that its\' not their responsibility to make up for Leviton\'s shitty receptacles.  And I agree that it\'s more on Leviton than on the EVSE companies.  I would still lobby to include a temperature sensor if I worked for one of those higher quality EVSE companies.  But more importantly, Leviton should take that off the market, or at least slap a label on saying ""not for EV charging"".  \n\nMeanwhile Leviton makes EVSEs.  So you might wonder whether they put temperature sensors in their plugs.  Nope, they make them hardwire only. That might be coincidence or it might be that the people there who do EV charging know the receptacles aren\'t good for that.', ""Sounds like a smart solution, to move the cord over from the other one and hardwire it.\n\nAs far as holding the receptacle while torquing, that is enough torque that it's not easy, but it's probably doesn't require anything special.

""should have been"" as in u/put_tape_on_it recommends that, or are you saying that\'s the correct sizing per code? \n\nAs I understand it, 8 awg should be on a 40 amp breaker. Not 50.  NEC says constant use is 80% of breaker size, so 80% of 40 is 32 amps.  For number 8, the breaker should have been 40, and the charger should have been set to 32 max amps.  Running 50 amp breaker on number 8, and setting the charger to 40 amps on a 50 amp breaker may have *just* been inside code with the type of wire and insulating rating temp rise, and distance, and other wires in the same conduit.... but *just*. Maybe.\n\nIt was installed minimally, pushed to the exact limits of code, that, *ALL BY ITSELF* may have been fine.  Add in any other contingency, such as worn outlet pins, a plug that has blades that are just a bit too thin for NEC code, inadequate torqued terminals, a full wire-box with other wire nuts in it that can generate other heat, a sketchy brand of outlet.... anything else... and something melts.    And a temp sensor in the EVSE plug would have stopped it from melting. \n\nTesla does it, Nissan\'s factory provided charger does it, GM\'s provided factory charger does it, I\'m sure others do, and furthermore, Tesla monitors the temp of the terminals in their hard wired chargers too.\n\nMost EV charger circuits will have a continuous run of wire from the breaker to the EV outlet or hardwired EV charger.  Could there be splices? Yeah. Would it be code? Yeah. Would it be probable to do it in practice? No. If the breaker end of that run isn\'t torqued correctly, the heat soaking in to the body of the breaker will cause the breaker to trip.  Neat how that works out!  If the outlet end isn\'t torqued correctly heat at the outlet end will get picked up by a plug temp sensor, and heat at a hardwired end will get picked up by a temp sensor in a hard wired EV charger.   Heat at the EV plug end will get picked up by the car\'s temp monitoring or the sensor in the EV charger\'s J1772 or NACs plug.\n\nEither way, there needs to be a sensor at the EV charger end or the even few and far between fires that these cause will absolutely be hyped up far and wide as reasons why EVs are just too dangerous to own.  Even a picture of a melted plug, circulating on social media is enough to convince some people that these electrics are just too dang dangerous.  There are people paid by oil and it\'s trade associations to push this type of EVs are dangerous stuff on social media. \n\n\nWe can all charge EVs in our garages and homes and not burn down.

DC charger options at home?,I'm looking at getting a DC charger installed at the house but don't know what to get.. looking at getting the esprinter but looking at it I'm limited to 9kw charging on AC it looks like..

How does an OBC limits current of an EVSE?,"Hi, I troubleshoot a lot of evse and get called on problems when something wrong happens. One of the most numerous problem I have is when the charge will stop after some time without completing. It looks to me like the On-Board Charger is the culprit  by over-heating or something. I corrected all those problems by reducing the EVSE output under the car's OBC capacity. It shouldnt be me doing that, it should be the OBC sending the right signal (duty cycle % on the pilot wire). Knowing an EVSE is only a contactor with no way of limiting the current as far as i know is the OBC absorbing the over current? For example, EVSE is 48A with an ID.4 having 30A capacity. Where are the extra 18A going? I couldnt find nowhere how the charging current was limited between the breaker and car battery. I understand the duty cycle signal but I mean the physical object/component limiting the current.",1,"['The car’s onboard charger is the component that determines the current draw and power into the battery, based on the limit communicated by the EVSE.', "">For example, EVSE is 48A with an ID.4 having 30A capacity. Where are the extra 18A going?\n\nThe EVSE sends a low-voltage communications signal to the car on the CP line that says:\n\n>Hello, I have 48 A available.  Let me know if you want me to turn on the power.  Feel free to use as much as you want up to 48 A.\n\nThen the can says:\n\n>Thanks.  Please turn on the power.\n\nThe EVSE then provides 240 V to the car.  The car decides to draw whatever amount of current it wants.\n\n>I couldnt find nowhere how the charging current was limited between the breaker and car battery.\n\nThat's what the OBC does.  It's very similar to charging a 12 V car battery with a charger you plug into a 120 V outlet.  The charger will typically have settings for different charging rates, maybe 10 A or 20 A.  In that case, those numbers are the current into the battery, but if you choose 20 A, that's 240 W at 12 V, so that same 240 W means drawing 2 A from the 120 V connection.  (Maybe 2.5 A in practice, or even 4 or 5, because of imperfect efficiency and some related issues.)  You don't need any third piece of hardware to limit the current."", 'Do you have the ability to test your vehicle with another EVSE at the same amperage?  That would tell you if it’s an issue with your onboard charger or if there is an issue with your EVSE.\n\nAny properly functioning EV should have no issue drawing its maximum power rating from the EVSE all the way up to maximum charge.', 'The EVSE is simply a relatively smart On/Off switch.  It tells the car what the maximum allowable current is, measures the current, and most likely measures its temperature.  It should have enough smarts to self protect if it overheats or the car tries to draw too much current.  \n\n  \nThe car handles the rest.  Since the input is AC and the battery is DC the car converts the incoming AC power to DC, and regulates the output, often using the exact same hardware that is used to power the car - essentially, charging an EV is regenerating the AC input where the electrical frequency is fixed at 60Hz, whereas while regenerating the electrical frequency will depend on the motor speed.  \n\n  \nSo, if you have a situation where EVSE is interrupting power flow, somewhere in the system an error is being generated, either correctly (due to an over-temp somewhere) or incorrectly (bad sensor), or some other communication or other fault is occurring.  \n\n  \nYou may want to hand over the job of troubleshooting these things to someone more knowledgeable.', ""There are car specific issues.

It is just a special case where the motor is spinning with an electrical frequency of 60Hz and a RMS value of 120V or 240V. When the EVSE is connected and turned on, the Solid State Relay is turned on and that AC voltage is connected to the H-Bridge in the car. How much current is drawn and converted to DC at the battery voltage is entirely dependent on the way the car PWMs the input. It operates as a boost just like the controller does when taking power out of the spinning motor. \n\nThe EVSE’s job is to communicate to the car how much current it is allowed to take and whether it has detected any problems.

How to lubricate … my EV charger plug ?,"Dear Redditors, I’m experiencing an issue with the T2 charging head plugging into my EV car (yes modern problems …).

Level 2 Charging from 240VAC delta transformer,"Hey all, I have a dilemma. We are designing an EVSE infrastructure of \~70 Level 2, 48A charge ports. Instead of transforming 480:208/120V we are planning on 480:240V delta-delta so that we can run 2-pole 240V to each port, thereby gaining higher power density per port (i.e. it would be \~10KW at 208V but would be 11.5KW at 240V). The problem when we are calculating load on the panel schedules. Essentially we are viewing each level 2 EVSE as a constant current (in this case 48A) independent of the voltage. And therefore, to calculate the KW per port, we're simply multiplying V\*I for power, then dividing that power by 2 for each of the 2 phases per port. E.g. for a 2-pole breaker loading: 48A through each phase and 5.75KW through each phase. The challenge comes when we are calculating the overall panel load with say, 10 ports connected. We're simply adding up the amps of each phase, then adding up the KW of each phase and that's our summary. The problem is that if you look at the total amps of the panel then multiply that by 240\*sqrt(3), we end up with a higher KW overall than what we're calculating by just adding up the KW of each individual phase. What are we missing?",2,"[""What you are missing is that the current multiple 48 A loads connected to a single phase leg are not all in phase with each other, so you have to do the vector sum rather than just the simple sum.  Except, the good news is that you don't have to do the vector sum--if you just add up the kW of each phase, that's equal to the kVA needed from the supply.  The vector sum might be good to work through to make sure you are confident that you got it right, but adding up kW is easier.\n\nThe complication of getting the vector sum right is the same as if you were doing it all on 208--there's no new complication that arises from the  240 delta.\n\nOne other consideration is that the voltage to ground will be 138 rather than the 120 that is present in normal 240 split phase or normal 208 split phase.  Most equipment will be perfectly happy with that but I would check the EVSE manuals and maybe even verify with the manufacturer that that's OK.  It's unlikely to be a problem but there's a non-zero chance of a design choice that could make the problematic, as least if 10% high line raised that to 152 V."", ""Yes, as already explained, it isn't as simple as adding up the amps, but that can be worked out. Have you made sure that your chargers will support corner-grounded delta though?\n\nWhen 277V is available, the best choice is to buck each circuit down to 240V, not to step down to 240V. Stepping down requires bigger transformers and makes it hard to convert to 277V in the future. (Since in the future, NACS chargers will accept 277V directly and attain even higher power density, although that will mostly have to wait until 240V-only cars die out.) Bucking also makes it 240V L-N, which will definitely avoid possible issues with any chargers not liking both lines being 240V to ground."", 'Several facets to this. \n\nFirst is 48A the right speed for your site?  If this is a movie theater, mall or other place people spend <6 hours, by all means carry on.  If this is a workplace with 8-9 hour dwell, you really oughta rescope this to lower power per-station (and more stations). If it\'s commuter rail or apartment charging with 10-15 hour dwell, you need a MUCH lower charge rate and hang more stations on that same power. (or save a fuckton of money, your call).  You have to design charge rates to fit the usage, you can\'t have rail commuters needing to move their car at 2 PM to avoid idle fees. \n\nOn to the electrical. \n\nFirst.  If your 480V is of the ""wye"" dialect, i.e. 277V phase-neutral is available to you,  you should be doing that instead.   Yes, J1772 stations cannot accept 277V - so you solve that with a transformer in buck mode.  In other words you get a 240V:36V transformer and configure it as an autotransformer with taps at 0V, 240V, and 276V.  (close enough).  Due to the magic of actually having paid attention in school, **the transformer only needs to be 1/6 the size** of the ones in your plan, which reduces space, money, *and heat removal* from the transformer area. \n\nSecond. Implementing Group Power Management is often a good idea.  Maybe not at a theater, but at employer, apartment, commuter rail, it\'s a GREAT way to mitigate the ""much lower charge rate"" issue and also provide peak performance.  With Group Power Management, when a car finishes, its allocated power is not simply wasted/unused.  It is redistributed to the other cars so they go faster.  This creates a crescendo where the last most needy cars charge very powerfully later in the day. However from a provisioning POV, Group Power Management is easy to provision because you simply set the amps you want the whole group to share.  E.G. say a 100kW transformer, that\'s 33kW per leg = 240V x 138 amps, that\'s what you set the Group Power Management to, that was easy.  And then you have 3 such groups, one on each phase. \n\nThird, that thing where you\'re getting stuck on the math - it\'s because you\'re doing 3-phase, but you\'re installing stations NOT in multiples of 3.  Stop that.  Or at least, round up to the nearest 3 when doing the math.  The math on 10 stations will be ugly and confusing. The math on 12 will be straightforward. \n\nBut again, don\'t be brute-forcing it with massive 480:240V transformers if you have ""Wye"" 277/480 available.  Not least, the bucking configuration makes them all compute as single-phase loads, which makes the math more recognizable.', ""What's the advantage to this over a 240/415 wye?"", ""You need to read the manual(s) for your EVSE(s) carefully. ChargePoint and Enphase (and the previous generations of Tesla Wall Connectors) require 120V to ground for each line. You can't use the B (stinger) phase at all."", 'I suggest you take a look at the cost and availability of the transformers and panel boards you need to do this. Supply chain has improved but it’s a fact that getting a panel board configured for 240D is going to be longer lead time and probably cost more than a 120/208 panel. \n\nAlso, you have to be careful with the 240D panels. You have to have the right breaker kits in them or you will lose a usable spot on the a or c phase of every 3 pole kit when you use 2 pole breakers.\n\nAlso, you can’t use slash rated breakers on a 240D system, so there’s another possible pain point if you have to add a circuit or replace a breaker. \n\nI guess my point is 240D had its place in the past but I so rarely see it anymore because use it just doesn’t pencil out like it used to.', 'Remindme!', ""Check your leg voltage. We have a similar setup at my work with 600/480/240 3 phase transformer (don't know if its delta-delta), we have a leg voltage of 147V which is over what the EVSEs I've been able tot find will allow for warranty coverage. That said, we have been running 3 clipper creek level 2 EVSE on this for over 5 years with no issues."", 'Just add the kW.', ""Awesome, thank you so much for your insight!  We are corner-grounding the B-phase in this scenario so I'm assuming that the voltage-ground for phases A and B would actually be 240V, correct?"", "">Since in the future, NACS chargers will accept 277V directly and attain even higher power density\n\nIsn't 277V support already part of the J3400/NACS standard?  Apparently all Teslas will accept 277V (though the Model S and X are apparently picky about voltage over 280)\n\nFor other EVs on the road with J1772 inlets, it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out with regards to the proliferation of NACS > J1772 adapters (not to be confused with NACS > CCS supercharger adapters)  Since 277V is outside the spec of J1772 it's doubtful that there will be much support, and since the J1772 protocol doesn't communicate voltage there's no way for the EV to know it's 277 until the contactors close and the EV gets a taste."", 'Do you know of examples of jobs that have been done this way?

And old J1772 vehicles with adapters won't provide the special handshake and won't be provided with 277.

Install a NEMA 14-50 outlet on the inside or outside of the garage?,"I want to put a level 2 charger at our family cabin. The panel in the garage can handle the load. I realize inside is best but the problem is the nearest outlet is not near the door and my 20ft charge cable wont reach where I normally park. If I have the outlet inside, I would then need to keep a door open for the cable while charging. 

Is there any downside to have the 14-50 outlet installed on the outside of the garage? I would get the outlet in a water proof housing but I know its not wise to get my evse wet. The other bonus of it being outside is family that uses the outlet for their camper can plug in easier. 

  
Thanks",1,"['Installing it on the outside of the garage is the right thing to do in your situation, and if you have a good quality weatherproof box with a good quality ""in use"" cover to protect it from rain, that takes care of that issue.  In either location, it is required to be on a GFCI breaker which is important for safety when people are plugging in and unplugging.  Note that RVs may have issues with nuisance tripping of the GFCI breaker, so there may be some troubleshooting involved to figure out what is causing that if that happens.  \n\nYou may have heard that 14-50 !receptacles are a common failure point in EV charging.  That\'s primarily attributable to people using low quality receptacles and installers, whether they are professional or diy, failing to tighten the terminals to the specified torque.  \n\nAnother thing you can do to minimize the chance of problems is to specify 6 gauge wire. A 50 amp circuit is allowed to use 8 gauge wire, which is smaller and runs hotter, if the type of wiring allows high temperature operation.  But you don\'t want that—you want it to run cool, and 6 gauge copper wire is the right choice for that.  The electrician will choose the type of wire used according to how it needs to be installed given the spaces it runs through. \n\nA portable charger will be fine outside in the rain now and then,  if it\'s a good quality safety certified unit.  If it was going to sit there plugged in for months at a time I would think about finding a way to locate it under a roof overhang or something so that it\'s not subjected to quite as much moisture.\n\nDon\'t worry too much about how often you are plugging and unplugging things.  For safety, it\'s a good idea to turn off the circuit breaker while you are doing that, but in terms of wearing it out if you get a good quality Bryant or Hubbell, you should be fine for years of daily cycles and decades of weekly cycles.  There\'s a lot of hand wringing about that on the internet, but it\'s mostly misplaced blame when people saw cheap ones burn up.   Cycles was a good initial hypothesis for why they burn up more often in EV charging duty than in other uses, but experience has shown that it\'s really the fact that EV charging is much more intensive electrically than RVs or stoves—the cheap ones fail even when there are few cycles of unplugging and plugging back in.', ""I don't personally think an EVSE really needs to be inside, vs other code-exceeding improvements like using hardwire.

If the cabin becomes the primary residence, that's a different matter.\n\nThe safest, most code compliant way is to pull separate circuits for the EVSE and the trailer. That could be two separate runs back to the panel, or one shared feeder to a new subpanel, which is then split into two separate circuits.\n\nIf the question is, can you hardwire any arbitrary 14-50-equipped EVSE, no, you cannot, you have to confirm in the installation instructions whether it is supported.

A Creative Way to Track EV Charging at Regular Unmetered Outlets,"Hi Reddit,

We’re a team of two indie programmers who built an app to solve our own problem: tracking EV charging costs at unmetered outlets in a condo/apartment setting. It calculates costs based on check-in and check-out times, peak and off-peak rates, and an optional margin for the service.

It’s designed for trusted environments where the owner and EV driver have a mutual understanding. This approach could also benefit others in similar trusted situations, avoiding the need for expensive hardware and subscriptions.

Would something like this work for you?
",1,"[""What kind of active user action is needed to use this? What kind of inputs does it use?\n\n(I'm not sure people would want to use a system that does not automate away all user intervention)"", 'Yes. Would this also work to track usage from charging at multiple networks?', ""Heads up: Rule 5, no self-promotion is allowed. Since this is such a niche thing I'm going to leave it. It's the sort of thing that's tough to find and it sounds like a simple side project."", ""Users check in and check out. It needs to be used in a trusted environment where the owner of the outlet knows and trusts you. \n\nDon't look at this as a universal solution. It's not. It satisfies a very small niche.\n\nIf people want a fully automatic system, they can spend the money on that. Our solution is essentially zero cost."", ""Only at power levels less than 20 kW because the power level is relatively flat for the entire session and this is what we base our calculations on. DC fast chargers vary their power level significantly throughout the session, so there's really no way for us to figure out how much power was transferred unless we're connected to some electronics in the vehicle or the station. Which we are not. \n\nSo maybe not this isn't really what it's designed for. Not sure why you would want to do that? Could you just add up the costs from the different networks at the end of the month?"", 'How does it defend against over and under count? Manual reconciliation if it ""feels wrong""?\n\nDoes it use fixed L2 charging speed to estimate the kWh and dollars? That has issues if EVEMS (and by extension power adjustment) is adopted more widely, as would be helpful for the EV ecosystem.', ""It's not a perfect system and not meant for widespread use. Niche 💯%\n\nLow power charging is very easy to estimate. It's a function of time because the power curve is pretty much flat for the whole charging session. \n\nBut it relies on trust. So you have to be in a setting where you know the owner of the outlet and the owner knows you and you both trust each other.\n\nSo it really doesn't defend against anything because it assumes trust. It just does its best with what information it has. And in our tests with level 2 stations, the accuracy is quite remarkable.\n\nBuilding owners can spend a lot of money on complex systems or they can rely on trust and use our app for basically free. It turns out trust can save them a lot of money and a lot of time.\n\nThat being said, we do have plans to support ocpp compliant chargers in the future."", 'Hmm, I can trust users to not lie, but I can’t trust them to clock in and out.
