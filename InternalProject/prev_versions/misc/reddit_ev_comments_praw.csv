m071bsm,tech57,"Work pickup vs lifestyle pickup.

People that buy ICE pickups can buy one for work or lifestyle. Those customers don't see Ford's EV version as useful in either situation. 

People that buy Tesla's pickup buy it for lifestyle. 

Look at all the early Tesla adopters back in the day. Do people really think they bought them as a tool to commute to work? Or maybe because they were new and cool and saving the world?

So back to Ford ICE pickup buyers, the ones that roll coal and cruise mall parking lots and go grocery shopping. Buying an EV pickup from Ford would be a negative to both work and lifestyle.

m070ow5,Recoil42,"Demand curves exist. No one's disputing that. Every product on earth (exclusive of Veblen Goods) experiences price-elastic demand.

The problem here is that Tesla needs to work their way down from $100k to $40k to even have a hope of fulfilling what's left of their initial reservations, and they have neither a record (nor realistically a hope) of doing that sort of thing. **The MY made it from \~$60k to \~$45k, not from \~$100k to \~40k.**

The CT which was pegged to peak at $69k (for a tri-motor, 500mi trim) when when it was first announced, doesn't even reach that price today at the the *lowest* trim level. It likely won't *ever*. All that demand has evaporated as a possibility.

You can say it's not alienation but rather an inability to meet the original quoted price, but vague mumbles of *""ahh yeah but they'll bring the price down, they always do""* are just wishcasting: They can't bring the price down that much. They don't have a hope in hell of doing it. Those targets have already been exposed as fantasy.",1733231358.0,1

ChargePoint only gives you a limited amount of time before next person is notified. While theoretically it could have problems, I found in practice ChargePoint worked well.  There never was “20 people setting up a reservation”, because the charger limits the reservations.

I’m just saying that if refill time is 10 minutes instead of 1-2 minutes, it’s not simply a drop in replacement model. That’s not the end of the world, it’s still doable, but now it’s absolutely critical that there are always available chargers (in good working order) the moment you pull up, or else your 10 minute fill can easily be 30-60 minutes

America has a lot of stations, now.  People pull up. Sit there and do a fast charge.  They drive more. People are making trips requiring 3+ chargers.  


If I had a 700km car in Ireland than I could drive from Dublin to Donegal and still have charge for a tour. I have not seen ubiquitous chargers yet.  I don't want to be on a panic and only find a slow charger going at 50c.  Can I really leave a car at lidl for 10 hours while the b&b is 10km away ?


I don't expect this to sell well in Ireland.  Where are the fast chargers ? Ford used to be #1 there.  Now we have family driving the Zoey, Ioniq, or an e208. Hyundai is definitely the big seller.  I expect Ford to die. Stellantis is definitely still in trouble. ",1733230162.0,1

The other folks commenting that you’re tripping your circuit breakers because you’re trying to pull too much (on that circuit).  

I’ve had the same issues here in Poland.  The solution for us was to put the “charger” on three phase, keep the charging rate low (if charging during the day) and to be careful about how much other stuff we had going on at the same time.  E.g. we make a point not to charge AND put the kettle on AND to have the electric heating on (via air conditioners) AND to have the stove top on all simultaneously.

m06wvaw,whimsy-penguin,"I thought about steel rims recently to make buying a winter tire set cheap.  I ended up going with Alloy for performance/efficiency reasons.  Here is a nice write up from ChatGPT:

# Steel Rims

* **Strength and Durability**: Steel rims are very strong and can handle heavy loads, which is suitable for EVs as they are typically heavier due to their battery packs.
* **Cost**: They are less expensive than alloy wheels.
* **Repairability**: Steel rims are easier to repair if bent or damaged.
* **Weight**: Steel wheels are heavier than alloy wheels, which can impact the performance and efficiency of an EV. The added weight may reduce range slightly and affect handling.

# Alloy Wheels

* **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Alloy wheels are lighter than steel rims, which improves handling, acceleration, and overall efficiency. This is particularly advantageous for EVs, as reduced weight helps maximize range.
* **Heat Dissipation**: Alloy wheels dissipate heat better, which can be beneficial for braking systems, especially in heavier EVs.
* **Appearance**: Alloys typically look more stylish and are available in various designs.
* **Cost and Durability**: Alloy wheels are more expensive than steel and are more prone to cracking under impact compared to steel rims.

# Conclusion

Steel rims can safely support the weight of an EV, but alloy wheels may provide better performance and efficiency. The choice depends on priorities:

* For cost-effectiveness and durability, **steel rims** are better.
* For performance, aesthetics, and range optimization, **alloy wheels** are the preferred option.

For EVs, manufacturers often equip them with alloy wheels due to their lighter weight and efficiency benefits.",1733229636.0,1

They're probably not because of T3, which will be an all new EV truck design from the ground up.  The Lightning was an interim step where a lot of things came together to make it feasible...The F-150 had no problem dealing with the extra weight and size of the battery packs without having to radically rethink either the frame or suspension (actually the distribution of that weight makes it handle better than the ICE version) and it was already a wildly popular product line.  Making an EV version is more than just swapping out the ICE motor for electric and strapping some batteries to it most of the time though.  All of that allowed Ford to be first legacy-automaker to market with an EV pickup while they work on the new product lines, and for all the talk of price they actually delivered on an MSRP *way* below Tesla, Chevy, and Rivian.",1733227380.0,6

>Spy shots have emerged of yet another new car from BYD. This time, it is a pure electric an all-electric sedan, which appears to be different from previously exposed pictures of the all-electric versions of the BYD Qin L and Seal 05.

>Autohome seems to suggest that the new model is an entry-level car, which is evidenced by the old-style door handles and small wheels. They also claim that the charging port on the right wing is usually reserved for entry-level products. They list the Seagull, Seal and Yuan Plus (Atto 3) as having the same layout. Car News China, however, would not exactly call the Seal an entry-level product.

>adding to the mystery is that there are no known new products for the Dynasty range, only the forthcoming Han L and Qin L, which have previously been exposed in spy shots. With the Ocean Network range, Zhang Zhuo, GM of the Ocean Network, said in November that it would launch a new SUV and create a 5678 product system. At the time, he didn’t mention any other new products.

>The spy shots suggest that the car is relatively compact and may well be smaller than the Qin. Presumably, the new car will be launched sometime during 2025. We will bring details of the new BYD as we receive them.",1733219265.0,2

You could then reimburse them for electricity used per month just like with rent. Also L2 chargers don't usually require huge wiring upgrade and that should be enough for overnight charging. 

Another option is to talk with your employer. They might give you access to the socket while you work, maybe even treat it as a work benefit and allow it for free or some small nominal fee.

If that doesn't work look for public charging near you. Depending on how much you drive you might get away with not charging every night.

\- Tesla opened reservations globally, but has only shipped to North America. A lot of people reserved here in NZ.

\- Peoples needs / wants change in the 2+ year period

\- Generally people over estimate their future financial position.

\- Inevitably some people won't like the final car (can be minor stuff like wanting 3x isofix in the second row, but there're are only two...

\- Some people just made reservations to speculate and flip the car's. May have worked for a very easily reservation, but there is no point in that any more

I leased the 2023 VinFast VF8 (VIN: RLLV1AFA6PH001258) on November 3, 2023, hoping to enjoy a modern, reliable electric vehicle. Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing due to multiple critical safety defects, poor customer service, and ongoing reliability issues.

**Safety Defects and Delayed Repairs**

Within just one week of taking delivery, I began encountering serious problems with the vehicle’s safety systems. I received error messages related to both the **Electronic Stability Control** and **Hydraulic Brake Assist** systems, indicating a failure in key components responsible for the vehicle’s safety. Despite reporting these issues to the service department immediately, I was told the earliest appointment for repairs would be a full month later, on **December 23rd, 2024**—a delay that I find completely unacceptable. Given the severity of these issues, the car is unsafe to drive, and the delay only amplifies my concerns about the company’s commitment to customer safety.

**New Problems Every Day**

As if the critical safety concerns weren't enough, new issues have cropped up almost daily. Recently, the **rear wiper** completely stopped working, adding another defect to an already long list of problems. It’s frustrating to purchase a brand-new vehicle only to face an ongoing stream of malfunctions, especially when the company is unable to provide timely solutions.

**Adaptive Cruise Control Failure**

Another significant issue I've encountered is with the **adaptive cruise control** system. After activating the feature, I received an error message stating “Adaptive Cruise Control Unavailable. System Fault,” rendering this feature—an important function of modern vehicles—completely useless. This only adds to the growing list of failures that have compromised the car’s usability.

**Charging Discrepancy and Misrepresentation**

One of the more frustrating issues has been with the vehicle’s range. On **November 26, 2024**, I charged the VF8 using a **ChargePoint** station, and after charging for 81.37 kWh, I was informed the car would have a range of **258 miles**. However, when I checked the vehicle’s screen, it showed a range of just **160 miles**, far below the expected performance. This discrepancy suggests that the vehicle’s charging system may not be functioning properly, further undermining my confidence in its reliability.

**Conclusion**

While I was initially excited about the VinFast VF8, my experience has been marred by poor quality control, safety concerns, and unhelpful customer service. The ongoing defects and delays have made it difficult to trust the vehicle, and I’m deeply disappointed by how the situation has been handled. I urge potential buyers to carefully consider these issues before making a purchase or lease, as my experience has proven that VinFast still has a lot of work to do when it comes to delivering a safe and reliable product.",1733204880.0,1

m058uyk,TumbleweedSmooth6676,"So we just leased a new VW ID.4 a few months ago.  Husband parks in our driveway.  We've had an Infiniti M35X in our driveway for many many years, with no rodent-chewing incidents.  Got in our car a few weeks ago and lots of error messages and no heat!  Drove it to the dealer and they said rodents were the culprit.  We've lived here for 20 years an nary a rodent wire-chewing incident.  Now we have the VW and within six months it's $1000 in damage.  Well, we have full coverage on the car with a $0 comp deductible because, lease, so we filed an insurance claim and it was covered 100% by insurance and we were provided a rental car while our VW was in the shop. Just a weird issue.  I mean, aren't cars supposed to be, er, outside? I personally do think this is an EV problem because we've never had this issue before and we've lived in the same house for 20 years and had other (gas) vehicles parked outside for at least ten of them.  We think this may have happened while parked at the airport during a trip, so who knows exactly where it occurred but we thought the VW guy was crazy when he called to tell us what was wrong with the car.

m053bvb,ga2500ev,"Not the correct approach IMHO. No one chooses to leave their car away from where they live. In addition unless there is a slow charger is available for every EV, eventually someone will be left out.

I feel that EV people in general make three faulty assumptions about public charging:

1. All EV folks have ""unlimited"" time to charge.

2. That because slow charging at home is so effective that that model should be propagated into public spaces.

3. That all DCFC options are too expensive to consider both in installation and operational costs.

People don't want to sit away from home for more than an hour to charge. People don't want to have to walk to and from home to a charger. People don't want to be stuck searching for a charger they can use to charge because the ones around them are going to be used for hours to charge. And people really don't want to pay exorbitant prices for ultra high speed fast charging on a regular basis.

Also I don't get how one can presume that someone in an apartment ""doesn't use the car a lot"". What's the justification for that?

Enough of the complaints. Here's the solution:

Medium speed DC chargers in the 25-30kW speed range.

1. They are priced about 3 for 1 with commercial L2 chargers. In addition they use the same electrical infrastructure as L2 stations meaning no extra transformers need to be installed and no electrical demand charges (at least here in Georgia).

2. They charge 3-5 times faster than L2.

3. They can give a 30-50% battery charge in about an hour. With enough access, there's not going to be a need to get a full charge each and every time one uses it.

4. The dwell time matches much more in line of what people do. An hour at the grocery, or at the gym, or the coffee shop, or the library is doable. 4-8 hours is a lot tougher.

5. There no longer needs to be a 1-1 match between chargers and EV as a medium speed DCFC can charge more than one car in a 4-8 hour period.

BTW I can list all of the counter arguments too:

1. It cost too much. Addressed in point 1 above.

2. It charges too slow. It's not a replacement for ultra high speed DCFC for long distance travel. It's a replacement for public L2 which point #2 addresses the speed difference.

3. There are not any out there. This is true, but not because they are not effective. I think there is a lack of awareness of their existence for than anything else. Coupled with slightly higher installation costs, a lot of businesses shy away.

If we could get every strip mall, big box, gym, apartment/condo, workplaces and standalone restaurant to install 1-4 of these units to create the access, a significant amount of the problems we have with people who cannot charge at home easily would have a lot more options.

That's not even true. Many voters based their decisions on the high inflation experienced during the Biden presidency, regardless of whether he was directly responsible or not, and despite the fact that the US was doing way better economically speaking than almost everyone else. 

Exit polls reveal that 68% of the electorate rated the economy as 'poor' or 'not so good.'

Commercial tariffs and demand charge computation is significantly more complicated and are usually several times as many pages.  The short version is that you a lot pay per unit power (kW) as well as a bit per unit energy (kWh).  Small businesses are sometimes on a legacy account under residential tariff service, and usually either a specific commercial tariff or a general tariff with demand charges and possibly time of use rates.

Because you're billed (heavily) per unit power, especially at peak times, adding an extra 50-100 kVA (=kW at 1.00 PF) can be a lot of money even if it's only for 20 minutes.

m04d41v,straightdge,">how is Apple gonna be able to take part of their supply chain out of China

The moment CCP sees that Apple is moving it's operations away from China, they will likely to levy huge tariffs or outright ban Apple. 

Apple makes [$30 billion](https://i.imgur.com/J7Fmkgq.png) operating profit from China, per year. They sell about 45 million iPhones annually within China. The GVA per iPhone for iPhone assembled within china is only about $40-$45 per unit. So for every iPhone Chinese buy, they essentially generate $600 profit for US. The Chinese are not getting much out of assembling the iPhone. 

Cons: Loss of low skill FATP roles, though some of them can be compensated by Huawei or other domestic manufacturer taking up the share from iPhone.

Pros: The entire profit and the supply chain can remain within China, thus providing more funding for their development. eg., Huawei Mate series sources all of its key components (SoC, memory, OLED, camera) from domestic sources. Even the chips are fabricated at SMIC (all thanks to sanctions by US). Losing on $30 billion of operating profit for Apple can be irreversible.",1733184323.0,1

they aren't great conductors, just better than humans. But they are intentionally conductive.

AI's addition:

Modern tires are less conductive than in the past because manufacturers have reduced the amount of carbon black in rubber compounds to reduce weight and rolling resistance. This can lead to a build-up of static electricity in the car, which can be a problem when exiting the vehicle or refueling. To address this, tire engineers have designed tires with grounding strips or antenna treads. These are thin strips of rubber with a special compound that provides a path for conductance between the tire and the road. ",1733183963.0,18

m0494fm,MrB2891,"No they didn't.

Or rather, it wasn't 'grounded'. Earth is not part of a mobile vehicles electric system. We use the term 'ground' in vehicles (including locomotives) colloquially.

Our AC power system uses the actual earth as a return path for fault current. The same is not true for a car, truck or locomotive. None of those systems use earth as part of their power system.

Literally, a vehicle 'ground' does not exist. Because there is no ground. There is 0v. The term ""chassis ground' is a bad term (even if it's accepted universally) as it has nothing to do with 'ground' in the design sense. The term should be 'chassis zero volt' as DC power systems (in the context of which we're talking about) don't have a ground. They don't even have a negative. They have +V and 0v. The terminals on your car battery should be labeled +12v and 0v (or, +400v or +800v and 0v in the context of a EV battery pack).

Yes, this is all an exercise in pedanticness to point out that fact that a car has no voltage potential between earth and cant possibly 'ground' the battery as the Ford dealer so exclaimed.",1733182888.0,5

But the cars weren't sold to customers, but yes to the dealerships that then got the option to sell them to real customers with their own deals and discounts. Whereas Tesla has no dealers, so every sold car was a direct sale to a real customer.
