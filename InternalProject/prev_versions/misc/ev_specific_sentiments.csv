For those who own an EV and charge at home, we spend the vast majority of the time of ownership experiencing vehicular bliss of literally never having to visit a gas station and no maintenance, just waking up to a fully charged vehicle and going about our business. Road trips require better planning for sure and there are some rural routes which are near untravellable. Don't get me wrong, more charging options will be great overall. Simply I've grown way, way beyond the idea that a little inconvenience in the 1-2 road trips a year I take outweigh the extreme benefits.",positive,0.9925738573074341,charging station charging

le3icon,StLandrew,8,"I have to record this for posterity. ""I own a ICE vehicle, but often will rent EVs for road trips as road trips are just better in EVs"".

Yes they are. I've driven in BEVs for several years now, but until recently had never used a Granny Lead. That is, the one that, in countries with 230-250V, you can charge overnight and receive a decent amount of charge. Still, I always thought that they were really there for emergencies. How wrong I was. A Granny Lead makes the inconvenient parts of BEV usage on road trips an absolute doddle. I accept that this works better in Britain and Europe, but let's say you set off on a holiday to get to a destination. Somewhere where you'll be staying but in the countryside. You have electricity when you get there, but otherwise nothing. No matter. Overnight you'll get 70+ miles into the battery. So you can run around the area with not a care.

And I run a VW ID3 - the pernickiest brand of BEV you could wish for. If a rapid charger is going to fail it'll do it on my car. But generally, they don't. That is, in the UK/Europe. Sometimes they do. But 5 minutes later we're up and running and I'm in the cafe next door, getting a coffee.

Going to say the T-word. Tesla. If you are are at all worried about any kind of charging reliability, get a Tesla. The Super and Destination chargers simply do not go wrong \[they do, but it's really, really, really rare\] and there are so many of them that there's always one around anyway. Even Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford recognised this. That's why he signed a deal with Tesla to let Fords use the Supercharger network. Then pretty much everyone else joined like dominoes falling.",positive,0.9969522953033447,charging
le3t74x,MBSMD,8,"The non-Tesla charging infrastructure along the route I take to visit family out of state is terrible, though there's a ton of Tesla Superchargers along the way. I have a Tesla Model 3 and no trouble at all charging on the way down and back, but my lease is up in March and I won't be getting another Tesla (because reasons). 

Unfortunately, I'm also kind of SOL insofar as getting a CCS-based or even a not-yet-in-existence NACS-based EV because there's very few generic CCS charging stations, and no third-party NACS chargers yet, along the routes I consistently travel (I've looked carefully). While plentiful, the Tesla Supercharger stations are either Gen 1 150KW or Gen 2 250KW, neither of which have Magic Docks, so I don't think any of them will work with non-Tesla vehicles (like a Volvo or a Kia EV) even with a proper NACS adapter -- though correct me if I'm wrong. 

And the few CCS-based charging stations that do exist along the route I travel have at most 4 stalls, some are 50KW max, and all are frequently ICE'd out or simply non-functional according to PlugShare. I simply cannot risk being stranded with nowhere to charge. There's a Walmart about half-way through my usual trip that has 16 Electrify America stalls, but I can't get to it on a single charge at highway speeds. In my Tesla, I usually stop twice to charge to 80% on the way down and again twice on the way back. At least I can L2 charge when I reach my family's place at the destination.

I will likely sit out this round after I turn in my Model 3 and get a plug-in hybrid instead, where I can at least drive electric around town and charge at home (so, remain electric 85% of the time), and not have to worry about finding appropriate charging stations when I travel long distances from home.

This 1 or 2 units at like half the stations in the country is shit.  Especially when half the chargers are down or deregulated most of the time.  EVs themselves are great, but the charging network here in the US sucks.

We go on road trips every other week and would need a reliable way to charge each time.  That's what makes me hesitant about getting my first EV this fall.  Gotta love the people on here complaining that road trips are a small portion of their experience and they charge at home most of the time.  So then, why are we complaining?  You are correct people.  Charging at home makes EVs great.  It's worrying about doing a road trip that is the problem.  Plus, many people don't just stay within an hour of home all the time.

Most of us know about industry practices of making electric and internal combustion vehicles that priorize profits to a fault, making designs that cause failure and issues that require an entire engine replacement, and in some cases, a completely new vehicle. Planned obsolescence aside, financially driven designing has sacrificed durability and sustainability to underengineer products have been industry practises for a hundred years or so. The model T was a car designed in this fashion and caused a manufacturing revolution.
  

 A lot of effort and research is going into manufacturers trying to create new technologies to be more efficient and cause less toxins to be released during manufacturing and vehicle usage, however opposite effort and research has gone into making sure the vehicles are as cheap to make as possible.  

 Designs that break down within a few years can cause massive amounts of trash, waste, and in the case of electric vehicles, e-waste. 

EV manufacturers have not made their battery packs easy to recycle, with most having substrate filled in between each cell. These substrates can be extremely hard and time consuming to remove. 
  
Internal combustion vehicles manufacturers have designed engines and components that fail. No matter how efficient a car is, if it's breaking down within a few years, that's a lot of resources wasted on mining, manufacturing, shipping, and then storing and recycling, f it does get recycled. Eventually we'll run out of space to store these broken downcars, and recycling them uses a lot of resources and causes toxic fumes and pollutants from the chemicals (unfortunately legally depending on country and illegally) released. Stored cars release pollutants as well.

 For example: I was watching a video about mechanics working on cars, and in one the 2018 Ford F150's 2.7L V6 was shown to have a thin rubber belt powering an oil pump inside the engine. TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 2.7L EcoBoost 23-2083 States:
 >Issue: Some 2015-2017 F-150 vehicles equipped with a 2.7L EcoBoost engine may exhibit an oil leak from the oil pan RTV seal. This may be due to various concerns with the oil pan. To correct the condition, follow the Service Procedure to replace the oil pan with the later style oil pan.  

 Leaking oil onto the roads and requiring a plastic drain pan be replaced for leaking oil more often than other designs is a lot of waste introduced to the environment.  

 There are regulations in some countries, states, and providences requiring EV vehicles become a percentage of manufacturers vehicle line up. I believe it would be useful to introduce regulations to disincentivise manufacturers from designing vehicles, vehicle components, engines, and engine components that fail more often than other designs.",Error,0.0,electric electric battery

If I had a car for 10k that had a range of 100 miles and the seating capacity for 2, I would happily buy it. 

My choices for 10k are either an 8 year old ICE machine or EV, and the cost of a battery replacement is so much, that it's terrifying to buy an out of warranty EV, towards the end of the battery lifetime. 

If I was to lease/but an EV, that I would use an average of 15 times per month, for 30 miles each time, that's one tank in an ICE car, costing $40 or $600 visit from an electrician to install a new breaker, conduit, and a outlet, plus $30 in electric cost.

The first year I owned an EV, I never installed my home charger -- I found I didn't need it -- I charged almost exclusively on those free L2 chargers. Then, chargers were plentiful and EVS were rare, so I was usually able to find an available L2 charger.

One frustrating aspect of public chargers on road trips is that many drivers don't understand how their car charges. My former BMW i3 had a max charge rate of 50 kWh, so I charged at the same rate on a 50 kWh charger as I would on a 350 kWh. This means I could leave the faster chargers open for the cars that can utilize the additional speed. 

Same principle applies for drivers charging to 100% every time.  In most cars, the last 20% of charging takes longer than the first 80% because the charging speeds taper off dramatically as the battery approaches 100%.

You could rightly argue that this is too much exposed technology and a driver should not need to know the quantiative aspects of their car's charging characteristics and I would probably agree with you.

le3m7og,skinnah,-1,"What issues did other companies see from the start that Tesla is suddenly going to experience? Tesla has had far and away the most EVs on the road in the US for many years. They've been pretty well tested for endurance already. 

EA had issues with charging stations derating early on with sparse usage. EA half assed their chargers. They are running the software side of them on Windows which is a really dumb choice for stability. You don't need to run Microsoft office on the things... They should have used a lightweight Linux OS.",positive,0.9986950755119324,charging
le4cvag,Deleted,3,"Yes that chargepoint model does not work for ROI, chargepoint is just too expensive rn to deploy for that situation. Their solution and price only works for smaller dozen stations max. 

What we need first in L2 is a bring your own cable solution on the market now as J3400 is finalised. The cables make up a majority of the production cost of L2 charging pedestals. Also less maintenance cost. If possible use 277v for power to reduce installation cost for smaller 3 phase areas.",positive,0.9992039799690247,charging

le87b0y,SomeGuyNamedPaul,1,The Powerwalls run in parallel and in the app appear as one unit.  You need them in parallel because inverter capacity is a limit with any home battery system.  My system gets 5 kW continuous and 7 kW for 20 seconds with the older PW2 units... times 3.  The newer ones do something like 11.5.  That's your actual limit for how much stuff you can have backed up with Powerwalls.  The practical limit is how much battery storage capacity you have versus run time.,positive,0.9954338669776917,battery battery

le58euw,ow__my__balls,0,"It was in my first sentence, none of the other auto manufacturers or charging companies are vertically integrated themselves let alone across the driving/charging experience. There are inherent issues that arise from needing to be compatible with other systems you have no control over.

le4gb9q,techno156,1,"The battery seems unnecessary. The proposal isn't to go off-grid and randomly plop them someplace, but to use them to offset the power draw of car charging if there are cars plugged in, whilst still offering about the same level of shelter.

le4g2ip,VTbuckeye,3,"A couple years ago one of the free L2 chargers about a mile from work switched to $$. It was actually free for the first 10 hours, then pay, but it changed to 0.19/kWh. There were 6 charge point stations with 2 plugs each (6.6kW split between each pair of plugs). 

I would L2 chargers maybe once per week for 9 hours, adding 35 to 40 percent while at work. once it became cheaper to charge at home then exclusively I stopped charging there. It was never fully occupied (rarely would it even be half occupied). Free stuff does lead to people taking advantage of it (in a good way and bad way). The cheapest option is almost always going to be the preferred option. Having free dcfc leads to even more issues particularly when there are fewer charging options and the cost to install chargers is far more expensive.",positive,0.9985380172729492,charging charging
legi0lg,JustSomeGuy556,1,"Yep.  This is the problem with L2 charging.  For most people, they largely charge home, so you can't really charge more than that, and at that level it's barely even worth the cost to process the payment for an hour or two of charging.  But you make it free and people will abuse it.

At the same time, you want people to not just sit in their car while it charges.

Maybe validate charging with a purchase like some places do for parking, combined with an idle fee?

I'd also like to see more ""Medium speed fast charging"".  Like, 25-50kw chargers around more businesses to encourage that hour long timeframe, but where it still makes sense to actually pay for the power.",positive,0.9972434043884277,charging fast

le73og2,Deleted,1,"Not very cheap: if in one hour you only get 3kWh, then it's still $ 0,33 per kWh. I'm paying € 0,336 at the public level 2 charger, around my home in the Netherlands as well. While it's not expensive either, I wouldn't call it very cheap.

Maybe just reasonable charging rate, or cheapish: but not very 😅",positive,0.997218132019043,charging
le4k30j,IM_The_Liquor,1,"Personally, I’d rather they just had paid parking type fee. $2/hr or whatever. I’ve seen a few that have 1-2 hours free then a rate that seem to do well enough for turn-over (though there are enough stubborn people out there who just unplug and restart their charge every hour). But yes, 24/7 free charging isn’t ideal.",positive,0.9831812977790833,charging
