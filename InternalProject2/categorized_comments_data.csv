d6juqob,Khnagar,53,norwegian here  30 celcius in the winter it works fine but range can be reduced by like 40 or some such   this is not a scientific fact but judging by myself and the half dozen other tesla owners i know it seems like range is reduced by less than half which is kind of a lot i guess fast charging takes longer the batterys not as good in that kind of cold and the heater draws more power  having said that its no problem driving to work and home again  everyone i know with a tesla has two cars in the family one tesla and one regular petrol car so theres that as well its not really a problem in any way drive to work and home again with 40 or 80 percent left on the battery thats just a number as long as youre not driving awfully far in one go,"['vehicle model', 'charger_type', 'availability_of_chargers', 'cost_of_charging', 'ev_range', 'charging_station_location', 'charging_network', 'charging_speed', 'charging_stations', 'tesla_charging_network', 'range_anxiety', 'maintenance_issues']"
d6junc4,BilbroTBaggins,160,hi there i have a masters degree on the performance of electric vehicles in cold climates i think i can help answer your question  all batteries have worse performance in terms of capacity and degradation at low temperatures this effect is greatest on leadbased batteries such as the ones regularly found in conventional cars and in some lithiumbased batteries i tested both lifepo4 batteries which performed amazingly well and lincm batteries similar to the chemistry in teslas cars which did not do nearly as well however these were lab tests on a few samples of one type of chemistry real world performance can vary significantly because of differences in electrode structure electrochemistry pack quality and a host of other things    luckily if you live in a cold climate none of this really matters that much whenever the car is plugged it it will run a thermal management system to keep the battery warm and once youre driving the water heat from the battery is more than enough to keep it at a nice temperature if you live somewhere cold enough for temperature to impact battery performance there will be plugs for block heaters in parking lots that you can use to charge and keep your car warm   unfortunately running a heater does affect the range you can expect about a 2540 hit in driving range on cold days   i expect batteries in evs will improve a lot in cold weather performance soon one way is by improving the structure of the anode the substrate that holds lithium ions when the battery is charged to be more resistant to wear and by improving electrolytes the material lithium ions flow through to be less resistive at low temperatures    all this to say that yes batteries perform worse in cold climates but the industry has and is continuing to make improvements to mitigate this ,"['vehicle model', 'ev_range', 'charger_type', 'charging_station_location', 'charging_stations', 'availability_of_chargers', 'charging_network', 'charging_speed', 'range_anxiety', 'maintenance_issues', 'cost_of_charging', 'tesla_charging_network']"

d6jy6ow,Confirmed_AM_EGINEER,1,yes yes and yes sorta   it takes an amazing amount of power to propel a car forward at 60 mph about varies a whole lot i am just going to use a number that make the math easy 20 kw 20kw is about 15 the power draw of a small house depending on your definition of small you can expect to use up about 2kw on climate control divides a tenth of the total it takes to propel the car forward this effectively reduces your range by 10 200 miles becomes 180 300 miles becomes 270 and so on   there is certainly something to be said about temperature affecting lithium ion energy storage but what i have found on this subject is  while parked an electric car can maintain the batteries at a nearly constant 70f with almost no range reduction due to power loss it is not debatable that the energy density of liion changes with temperature it does engineers just do what they can to keep the temperature as constant as possible   all of what i have said does not directly make battery lifespan shorter that is fully down to the user liion batteries like two things very much indeed low cycle depth and midcapacity fill low cycle depth refers to only depleting a small amount of battery say 10 maximum if you can make all of your trips so that you only ever use 10 of the battery capacity a 10 depth of discharge then you could greatly extend the life of your battery midcapacity fill refers to the battery wanting to be at 50 fill at all times there are tesla owners that simply refuse to charge their tesla past 75 for this reason so if you were to do everything in you power to extend the lifespan of a liion battery you would know that your commute uses 20 of the battery an would accordingly charge the battery to 60 that way you are as close to 50 fill as possible at all times   this technique is extremely effective some tesla owners report over 1000 chargedischarge cycles like this with less than 1 battery degradation     all numbers may be wrong this is just to give you a general idea of the concept i read about this a lot but did not directly source anything,"['vehicle model', 'charging_speed', 'ev_range', 'charger_type', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_station_location', 'availability_of_chargers', 'charging_stations', 'tesla_charging_network', 'charging_network', 'maintenance_issues', 'range_anxiety']"

d6kohvv,rytius33,1,well to start i dont believe i said hey these are the magic numbers that fit every single person in the world who owns a gas engine quote me if you like but i said the average cost and if you do your own maintenance yes it lowers the numbers because you obviously are not paying a mechanic however i should have been more specific i guess in saying that my numbers are based off of mechanic costs regular maintenance etc just tire rotations and oil changes for the recommended about is equal to over half of your 300400 per year now take into account that most likely at some point in the life of the car and not you specifically but an average that there are some bigger issues that come into fold say your transmission goes out thats going to cost anywhere from 15003000 dollars depending on what you drive now i will admit my numbers are based on the nissan leaf i did say i worked for nissan so again i could have been more specific there too but as of right now the cost of replacing 2 battery cells is about 100 dollars give or take depending on where you get it tax etc now take the price of the leaf sv around 30k a normal vehicle after interest taxes etc is going to be anywhere between 3540k the leaf however after you factor in incentives the tax write off etc which brings it down to a whopping 15k mind you will probably be about 20k after interest and taxes over half the price to begin with now remove all the potential gas costs oil costs all of the stuff you dont have to worry about with a gas engine vehicle that is where i am getting my numbers from oh and nissan is working a deal right now with lg to develop a process for the battery cells to lower that will lower the price from 100 dollars for 2 cells to 45 dollars so even more savings again i did not say this fits every single situation in the world i specifically said the average,"['vehicle model', 'maintenance_issues', 'charger_type', 'ev_range', 'charging_network', 'charging_speed', 'charging_stations', 'range_anxiety', 'charging_station_location', 'cost_of_charging', 'tesla_charging_network', 'availability_of_chargers']"

d6kc48j,Te3k,6,yeah hybridsthats where the state of the art is currently no pun intended use battery and fall back on gasoline when necessary eg longrange trips but in 510 years that standard will likely change for example range on the new teslas is 346402km 215250 miles depending on battery features and they can recharge 270km 168 miles of range in 30 minutes at a fastcharge station so have a stretch do a grocery run get a coffee etc and be on your way you just gotta plan it on a roadtrip that surpasses 400km youll be making those kinds of stops anyway do a full charge at night wherever you sleep  the hope would be that the batteries get better charging infrastructure continues to roll out and people get on board with the idea of having public chargers because it attracts businesses to cafés malls and grocers etc teslas goal of putting chargers up all along the highways is a great idea with government backing and every manufacturer racing to produce higher tech well see that transition to fully electric sooner than we think   my first vehicle is a custombuilt electric motorbike and im so stoked on the tech i feel like ill never get a gas car if i can avoidafford it like cable television with 80150km of range depending on how aggressively i drive and a 65 charge in 2 hours 4 hours for fullcharge from any normal outlet its my daily driver deadly silent topspeeds of over 120kmph 080kmph in 35s not good for roadtrips because highway speeds kill the battery fast and annoying in bad weather hence an electric car would be a sweet thing to have in say 510 years or a hybrid if i were to get one now,"['vehicle model', 'availability_of_chargers', 'charger_type', 'charging_speed', 'ev_range', 'charging_stations', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_station_location', 'charging_network', 'tesla_charging_network', 'range_anxiety', 'maintenance_issues']"

d6kdkb6,biosehnsucht,1,superchargers are typically spaced around 130 miles or so apart so that in the worst weather even the vehicles with smaller batteries can safely make it to the next stop   you dont have to drive for 200 miles 3 hours and then charge for an hour you can instead drive for 130 miles less than 2 hours charge for half an hour or less and be on your way again with enough juice to make the next supercharger easily you dont fill up unless you just want to kill time  the last 20 takes 50 of the charge time because battery chemistry reasons  you actually end up averaging slightly slower average sped assuming 215 miles of 100 charge range at that there were superchargers available at exactly that interval for the full charging method of 52mph vs 55mph superchargers at normal existing spacing drive to next charge to 80 continue to next sc   im sure youre now horrified that youd be averaging so far below the speed limit vs driving an ice at 70mph for 400 miles and then refueling with a speed run pit stop in 10 minutes averaging 68mph  on the other hand if you have a vehicle with a larger battery the  charge rate is essentially the same 80 in 30 minutes but that translates into far more range 80 of 215  172 80 of 294  235 so you can actually get the same range as the smaller battery vehicle in 20 minutes  as total range improves so does the time needed to charge a given range of miles give it a few years and you can probably get a 400 mile car that can charge 300 miles in 30 minutes or 150 miles in just around 10 minutes the lower the state of charge the faster charging is now theyre practically on par  and thats only assuming the normal improvements to battery range without any improvements to charging speed  an ev may not be practical for everyone yet but give it 5 years and youll be having a hard time making a good argument against them  meanwhile for those of us who arent driving alone and thus cannot force a speed run at every stop and prefer not to wear ourselves out with marathon driving sessions ev tech is already good enough at least if you buy a tesla  everyone else is still playing catch up perhaps not yet affordable for most but thats what the model 3 is for but practical,"['availability_of_chargers', 'vehicle model', 'ev_range', 'charger_type', 'charging_speed', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_stations', 'tesla_charging_network', 'charging_station_location', 'range_anxiety', 'charging_network', 'maintenance_issues']"

d6jrttu,rich000,1,the problem is that you cant have 100 utilization and charging every 75 miles or whatever the range is at the same time  when youre charging youre not getting utilization  now if youre fast charging and driverless then sure you can have your cars pulling into a charging station every three hours  that still involves some downtime though and overhead  of course one thing an uber car could do is drive until it is down to 5 and then return to base  unlike a car that is doing a regular commute the uber car can choose which routes it does  if it has 10 miles left on the battery it can pick a route that uses up 8 of those before getting back to the charger  you still have to look at all the numbers though  a hybrid gas engine could do all of these things as well  it would get lower efficiency but it would have less downtime and have fewer routing constraints when it needs to get to a charger  ,"['vehicle model', 'charger_type', 'availability_of_chargers', 'charging_speed', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_stations', 'charging_station_location', 'ev_range', 'charging_network', 'range_anxiety', 'maintenance_issues', 'tesla_charging_network']"

j7q4dag,spewing-oil,2,you are trying to make a point using gas pumps as a reference gas stations can be converted for higher level charging for road trip use or emergency most will want to avoid paying for their use   charging ports level 1 can be installed pretty much anywhere level 2 at garages and parking lots for home work and play   what will help drive the demand for level 12 charger build out are the people that cannot charge at home and that percentage of drivers is way way below 70 so imo the build out will be slow and steady,"['availability_of_chargers', 'charger_type', 'charging_stations', 'charging_station_location', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_speed', 'vehicle model', 'ev_range', 'charging_network', 'range_anxiety', 'tesla_charging_network', 'maintenance_issues']"

j7qdba5,spewing-oil,2,the topic was charging situation for apartment dwellers and others who cant charge at home and the amount of usa in that situation   fact is the majority of drivers live in single family homes those same people must to go to the gas station to fill up so switching to electric immediately drastically reduces public refueling need   other than roadtrips a lot of people will have other places  opportunities to charge than waiting at a station you have to park the car after all we have an enormous amount of parking places and many people dont need to constantly recharge or for it to be fast when they do   there is a problem currently but luckily we have lots of time before ice cars are phased out i dont see any concern considering the majors are just now starting to mass produce electric vehicles,"['availability_of_chargers', 'charger_type', 'vehicle model', 'ev_range', 'range_anxiety', 'charging_station_location', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_network', 'tesla_charging_network', 'charging_stations', 'charging_speed', 'maintenance_issues']"

j7rfl9s,spewing-oil,1,hydrogen is tough to handle since its a gas youd rather flow it but pipelines needed are a huge pain in the ass and are expensive to build you have to continuously monitor leaks and integrity right now its transported by trucks to the stations but thats a volumetrically limited solution   liquid hydrogen requires very special tankers to transport and requires energy to liquify   throwing hydrogen in with other gas pipelines is great but eventually its on its own and its a huge headache   i can see highly motivated industrial gas consumers wanting to take on handling hydrogen so they can burn it to cut co2 emissions i think its part of the greater solution along with ammonia but not for cars,"['vehicle model', 'maintenance_issues', 'charging_stations', 'charger_type', 'availability_of_chargers', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_station_location', 'range_anxiety', 'charging_speed', 'charging_network', 'ev_range', 'tesla_charging_network']"

j7sng7y,spewing-oil,1,anytime someone brings up hydrogen cars i immediately think of how toyota has pushed the hydrogen narrative so hard over the last 10 years   im not worried about the world running out of lithium at all itll be found i hope it can be mined  evaporated as efficiently and environmentally friendly as possible i am concerned the slowness of ramping up mining inhibiting ev adoption its been overshadowed by the chip shortage but lce production isnt going to be able to keep up soon,"['vehicle model', 'charger_type', 'range_anxiety', 'ev_range', 'charging_speed', 'cost_of_charging', 'charging_network', 'charging_station_location', 'availability_of_chargers', 'maintenance_issues', 'tesla_charging_network', 'charging_stations']"
