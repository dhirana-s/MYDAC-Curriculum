INFO:root:Comment: the nontesla charging infrastructure along the route i take to visit family out of state is terrible though theres a ton of tesla superchargers along the way i have a tesla model 3 and no trouble at all charging on the way down and back but my lease is up in march and i wont be getting another tesla because reasons   unfortunately im also kind of sol insofar as getting a ccsbased or even a notyetinexistence nacsbased ev because theres very few generic ccs charging stations and no thirdparty nacs chargers yet along the routes i consistently travel ive looked carefully while plentiful the tesla supercharger stations are either gen 1 150kw or gen 2 250kw neither of which have magic docks so i dont think any of them will work with nontesla vehicles like a volvo or a kia ev even with a proper nacs adapter  though correct me if im wrong   and the few ccsbased charging stations that do exist along the route i travel have at most 4 stalls some are 50kw max and all are frequently iced out or simply nonfunctional according to plugshare i simply cannot risk being stranded with nowhere to charge theres a walmart about halfway through my usual trip that has 16 electrify america stalls but i cant get to it on a single charge at highway speeds in my tesla i usually stop twice to charge to 80 on the way down and again twice on the way back at least i can l2 charge when i reach my familys place at the destination  i will likely sit out this round after i turn in my model 3 and get a plugin hybrid instead where i can at least drive electric around town and charge at home so remain electric 85 of the time and not have to worry about finding appropriate charging stations when i travel long distances from home   ill see what the charging ecosystem looks like in another 34 years  hopefully better though if djt gets elected im worried that itll potentially look worse than it does today

INFO:root:Comment: i completely agree  i have rented evs and the reliability issue with charging stations is the biggest problem  also stations need to be like tesla with a minimum of 8 units  this 1 or 2 units at like half the stations in the country is shit  especially when half the chargers are down or deregulated most of the time  evs themselves are great but the charging network here in the us sucks  we go on road trips every other week and would need a reliable way to charge each time  thats what makes me hesitant about getting my first ev this fall  gotta love the people on here complaining that road trips are a small portion of their experience and they charge at home most of the time  so then why are we complaining  you are correct people  charging at home makes evs great  its worrying about doing a road trip that is the problem  plus many people dont just stay within an hour of home all the time  ev charging on road trips are a pita for nontesla owners  if we want evs to grow and overtake ice vehicles we need a more reliable charging network  period

INFO:root:Comment: and reliability in general     most of us know about industry practices of making electric and internal combustion vehicles that priorize profits to a fault making designs that cause failure and issues that require an entire engine replacement and in some cases a completely new vehicle planned obsolescence aside financially driven designing has sacrificed durability and sustainability to underengineer products have been industry practises for a hundred years or so the model t was a car designed in this fashion and caused a manufacturing revolution      a lot of effort and research is going into manufacturers trying to create new technologies to be more efficient and cause less toxins to be released during manufacturing and vehicle usage however opposite effort and research has gone into making sure the vehicles are as cheap to make as possible     designs that break down within a few years can cause massive amounts of trash waste and in the case of electric vehicles ewaste   ev manufacturers have not made their battery packs easy to recycle with most having substrate filled in between each cell these substrates can be extremely hard and time consuming to remove     internal combustion vehicles manufacturers have designed engines and components that fail no matter how efficient a car is if its breaking down within a few years thats a lot of resources wasted on mining manufacturing shipping and then storing and recycling f it does get recycled eventually well run out of space to store these broken downcars and recycling them uses a lot of resources and causes toxic fumes and pollutants from the chemicals unfortunately legally depending on country and illegally released stored cars release pollutants as well   for example i was watching a video about mechanics working on cars and in one the 2018 ford f150s 27l v6 was shown to have a thin rubber belt powering an oil pump inside the engine technical service bulletin 27l ecoboost 232083 states  issue some 20152017 f150 vehicles equipped with a 27l ecoboost engine may exhibit an oil leak from the oil pan rtv seal this may be due to various concerns with the oil pan to correct the condition follow the service procedure to replace the oil pan with the later style oil pan     leaking oil onto the roads and requiring a plastic drain pan be replaced for leaking oil more often than other designs is a lot of waste introduced to the environment     there are regulations in some countries states and providences requiring ev vehicles become a percentage of manufacturers vehicle line up i believe it would be useful to introduce regulations to disincentivise manufacturers from designing vehicles vehicle components engines and engine components that fail more often than other designs

INFO:root:Comment: my city has free l2 chargers in the downtown area the first year i owned an ev i never installed my home charger  i found i didnt need it  i charged almost exclusively on those free l2 chargers then chargers were plentiful and evs were rare so i was usually able to find an available l2 charger  one frustrating aspect of public chargers on road trips is that many drivers dont understand how their car charges my former bmw i3 had a max charge rate of 50 kwh so i charged at the same rate on a 50 kwh charger as i would on a 350 kwh this means i could leave the faster chargers open for the cars that can utilize the additional speed   same principle applies for drivers charging to 100 every time  in most cars the last 20 of charging takes longer than the first 80 because the charging speeds taper off dramatically as the battery approaches 100  you could rightly argue that this is too much exposed technology and a driver should not need to know the quantiative aspects of their cars charging characteristics and i would probably agree with you i expect that this problem will plague ev ownership until we develop a better charging model so drivers will not need to know anything about charging and can just plug in their car and charge

INFO:root:Comment:  the extra money spent in the centre will more than make up for the costs  it doesnt and often times you dont have the overhead or buffer available to add that kind of load its easy to add maybe 46 chargers but it cant be free unless your mall is huge but then the infrastructure cost to add a large volume of chargerswell youre better off just fronting the cost to install dcfc because you get a lot more bang for the buck  people need to understand that l2 chargers dont exactly scale like in a single family home you cant just keep adding to an existing service most homes typ 200amp service will likely have the buffer available to add a 3060 amp circuit or even 2 because your house typically cant draw that much power even if you tried because consumer products are not that power hungry most commercial spaces like say a 510 unit plaza they probably run off a 3 phase 120208 1200 amp service and depending on their configuration and the demands of each unit probably dont leave much headroom you might be able to get away with install 34 chargers without any extensive service upgrades in most cases however to go beyond that youre probably looking to bring in higher voltage like 277480 or 347600v and owning your own step down transformer on the property and if thats the upgrade youre paying for then routing higher voltage directly to dcfcs and configuring 1020 chargers your net investment cost isnt prohibitively more because the infrastructure upgrade is already a very costly investment
