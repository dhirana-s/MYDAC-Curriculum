    "So there's kurtosis in the 6000s (should be around 3) and skewness in 80s (should be around 1) its very high even for financial data from a good source cos it suggests heavy-tailed distributions far from normality and extreme outliers. could be outliers but i googled and saw the years in the data are the 1997 asian financial crisis, 2001 recession, 2008 global recession Taiwan faced. But tbh the high skewness in financial data makes sense cos of the nature of how assets and liabilities behave in real world aka right skewed distribution since small no. of firms will have most of market value/revenue. Also bankruptcies are rare events that the model must capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "So things to do:\n",
    "1. find the key features w extreme values/skewness by reviewing feature importance\n",
    "2. apply log transformation to features with high skewness\n",
    "3. use tree-based model random forst which handles outliers and skewed data better\n",
    "4. Keep in mind that your target variable (bankruptcy) is likely highly imbalanced (i.e., most companies won't go bankrupt). This imbalance itself can introduce skewness into your dataset. You may need to use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or class weighting in your model to account for the imbalance."
